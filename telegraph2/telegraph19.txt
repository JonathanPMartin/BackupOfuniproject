Boris Johnson to write memoir about his time as PM after signing seven-figure deal
Boris Johnson is to give his account of his 
 after signing a deal for his memoirs thought to be worth a seven figure sum with Rupert Murdoch&#39;s book publisher HarperCollins.
The former Prime Minister is likely to start work on the account later this year when he has finished a much delayed biography of William Shakespeare.
Arabella Pike, publishing director at HarperCollins&#39; imprint William Collins, described the prospect of the book as &#34;a prime ministerial memoir like no other&#34;.
She added: &#34;I look forward to working with Boris Johnson as he writes his account of his time in office during some of the most momentous events the United Kingdom has seen in recent times.&#34;
The book is expected to cover Mr Johnson&#39;s time in office, from his appointment as Foreign secretary after the 2016 EU referendum, through the &#39;Brexit wars&#39; in Parliament until after he became leader and Prime Minister in 2019.
The so far untitled memoir will give the definitive account of the 2019 general election landslide, taking the UK out of the European Union in 2020 and the Government&#39;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine.
It will also allow Mr Johnson to give his account of 
 at the hands of his own MPs last summer, in the wake of the partygate and other scandals.
A close MP ally told The Telegraph on Monday night: &#34;Boris Johnson lives inside lots of people&#39;s heads rent-free so writing a book will be a good opportunity to put his version of events on the table for the record.&#34;
Mr Johnson, 58, who was a reporter and columnist for The Daily Telegraph for three decades before he entered government, was sometimes, when he was Prime Minister, clutching a reporter&#39;s notepad, with the date on it, suggesting he will be able to reply on contemporaneous notes for his memoir.
His memoir will come after his former Culture secretary Nadine Dorries publishes her account of Mr Johnson&#39;s downfall, titled &#39;The Plot&#39;. Mr Johnson is said to have told his allies to &#34;tell her everything&#34;.
Mr Johnson is expected to start work on the memoir after he has completed his work on Shakespeare - Shakespeare: The Riddle of Genius - which was originally commissioned by publisher Hodder and Stoughton in 2015, with a £88,000 advance.
Mr Johnson has written almost a dozen books, including a biography of Winston Churchill, The Churchill Factor, and the self-illustrated children’s book The Perils Of Pushy Parents, selling nearly 613,000 copies.
HarperCollins bought the worldwide rights to the book in a deal negotiated by Natasha Fairweather at book agents Rogers, Coleridge &amp; White.
HarperCollins - controlled by News Corp, which is controlled by newspaper publisher Rupert Murdoch, has a history of publishing prime ministers’ memoirs, having snapped up the rights to David Cameron’s &#39;For the Record&#39;, published in 2019, for up to £1 million.
Mr Johnson is widely expected to have agreed an advance of well over £1 million for his memoirs. The sum paid is unlikely to be as high as the £4.6 million paid to former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair for his Downing St memoir, &#39;A Journey&#39;, published in 2010.
Mr Johnson declined to comment. A friend said he will disclose any cash advance in the usual way to the House of Commons.
The journalist in Mr Johnson will also know that speedy memoir will ensure his account of his time in politics is still relevant to the modern day fast moving political environment.
He will want to avoid the fate of Mr Cameron who quit as PM in 2016 but only published his account of his time in office three years later in 2019, largely to a collective shrug from the Westminster village.
