Elderly patients &#39;will be trapped in hospital at Christmas’ by NHS strikes
Elderly patients who are fit to be sent home are likely to be stuck in hospital over Christmas owing to strikes by nurses and paramedics, a senior NHS source has warned, amid fears disruption could last all week.
On Tuesday, thousands of nurses will walk out of hospitals across the country in a dispute over pay, while 
paramedics and 999 call handlers will strike
 for the first time in 30 years on Wednesday.
Hospitals were ordered on Friday to send home as many patients as possible in an attempt to prevent overcrowding in A&amp;E departments, but there are concerns that the industrial action will affect the discharge of some patients who would otherwise be sent home to spend Christmas with their families.
A senior NHS source warned: “There’s a risk with the strikes that problems with discharges will be accentuated, and therefore there is a risk that some elderly people end up in hospital over Christmas.”
One ambulance service has said there will be no patient transfers between hospitals, or transport from hospitals to homes or to care homes during the strikes and that disruption could last up to three days.
It comes as Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, suggested on Sunday that 
 should make their own way to hospital on Wednesday rather than ringing 999.
Members of the Armed Forces have been called in to help replace the striking workers, but The Telegraph can reveal government plans 
to use reservists instead in future
On Sunday night, it emerged that Steve Barclay, the Health Secretary, was expected to write to the Royal College of Nursing urging fresh talks to end the strikes, amid plans for further walkouts in the new year.
Speaking on a visit to Chelmsford Ambulance Operations Centre, Mr Barclay said: “It’s important that the trade unions honour the commitment they’ve given to safeguard both life-threatening responses and emergency responses.
“We haven’t actually had that confirmed in the practical arrangements that the unions put in place at each trust.
“I’m calling on them to do so. I’m very keen to continue working with them because all of us should be focused on patient safety.
“But if the trade unions insist on only answering calls from the picket line then that in turn creates a delay which can have 
The union has asked for a 19 per cent pay rise, which has been rejected by ministers. The Government has resisted calls for the independent NHS Pay Review Body to look again at its recommendation of an average salary boost of 4.75 per cent 
for nurses in England and Wales
Downing Street is also understood to have rejected a suggestion that nurses be offered a one-off cost of living payment in an effort to end the strikes.
Ambulance workers have been given a four per cent pay award, but want a boost in line with inflation, currently running at around 11 per cent.
Health bosses and ministers fear the ambulance strike will be more disruptive than the walkouts by nurses, who first took industrial action on Thursday last week.
A source warned that although the nurses’ strike was “psychologically a big deal… the ambulance strike [will have] 
a much greater impact across the NHS
“At least an ambulance is a clinical area, a corridor or a seating area... is not a clinical area. It does not have all the facilities an ambulance has,” the source said.
Health bosses have urged hospitals to take “risk-based decisions” to speed up patient discharges, freeing up beds which will allow ambulance crews to hand over patients to A&amp;E quicker 
Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said 
 were  an “extra incentive” to ensure patients are discharged quickly and safely. But, he added: “With over 13,300 hospital people currently in beds they don’t need to be in, this is a tall order”.
The walkout by nurses is likely to impact getting patients home before the weekend, as they are often central to arranging discharge plans and contacting social care providers.
A senior NHS source told The Telegraph that the long Christmas weekend could also exacerbate issues, as discharges tend to slow over bank holidays because fewer staff are on shift.
“You’ve got a combination of two things there, [it’s] not just the strikes, but the long weekend. It’s a double whammy,” they said.
Health chiefs are today urging people to continue to access emergency care if they need it and call NHS 111 to discuss complex medical problems.
Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: “Ahead of further industrial action this week, the NHS is encouraging people to continue to come forward for the care they need and if you haven’t been contacted about your appointment, please attend as you normally would.”
Our 999 services continue to be under pressure today.
The best way you can 
 is by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies 🚑
Our people are working hard to get everyone the help they need 💚

Unions are still negotiating local agreements with ambulance trusts about which calls will be responded to during Wednesday’s strike.
However, South Western Ambulance Service warned the public to “think carefully” before calling 999 during the strike, as they may only be able to respond to calls “where is the most immediate risk to life”.
The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), where 
both the GMB and Unite members will walk out
, said it was expecting “operational challenges to last for a further 48 hours, so our advice is to place for 72 hours of disruption”.
A leaked letter from Dr Chris Grant, medical director for NWAS, revealed paramedics would not carry out any patient transfers between hospitals, there would be no transport home services and care homes will be advised to use taxis to collect patients.
Nadra Ahmed, of the National Care Association, said the strike action would “compound” the issue of delayed discharges. She told The Telegraph some of her members have reported having plenty of beds for patients, but are yet to be contacted by nearby hospitals.
“We should be under no illusion that the part of the reason that we haven’t been able to discharge smoothly [in the past] will be based around the fact that the packages of care have not been in place, so I’m not sure how we can work miracles by doing it within a few hours tomorrow,” she said.
Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said there was a “crucial balance” between sending patients home ahead of the strike action and rushing discharges.
“On the one hand, the sooner someone can go home the better, especially with Christmas on the way, but on the other the right support must be in place for them, to keep them safe and enable them to recover well,” she said.
“We know that home care shortages are delaying discharges in many places, but hospitals mustn’t cut corners 
where frail older people are concerned
, or they will solve one problem but create another, potentially putting older people at risk in their own homes.” 
‘Patient safety and care is at our core’
Dr Tim Cooksley, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said this week will be “particularly tough for those working in urgent and emergency care”.
He added: “We continue to take great pride in the work our teams are doing. We are not currently providing the standards of care we hope to deliver, but at all times patient safety and care is at our core.
“We will work tirelessly to support patients and hopefully be able to discharge many patients so they can spend the Christmas holiday with their family.”
Mr Dowden said “our door is always open to engagement with the unions”, but he maintained the official position that the RCN’s demand for a pay rise of five per cent above inflation is “simply not affordable”.
He argued there is “logic” in sticking to the recommendations of 
the NHS’s independent pay review body
 because they are “supposed to take the politics out of this”.
“I would say to people across the private and the public sector... we’re trying to be reasonable, we’re trying to be proportionate and we’re trying to be fair,” he told BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.
unions need to be fair and reasonable
. They should call off these strikes and give people a break.”
He insisted that the public would be 
able to rely on ambulance services
 for life-threatening injuries during the strike action.
But he said those with “less serious injuries should… seek to make your way to hospital on your own if you are able to do so”.
