Times New Roman has been outlawed by the 
 due to it being harder for visually impaired people or those who have difficulty reading to decipher, reports say.
It comes days after US secretary of state 
 hit headlines for telling staff they should ditch the font in favour of adopting “Calibri as the standard,” according to a cable obtained by 
today suggests the UK government department took the decision far in advance of Mr Blinken, advising its 
 to avoid Times New Roman a year ago.
A Home Office website reportedly says that the department’s own design system and that used by the main GOV.UK site “both use fonts chosen for clarity and readability”.

“Because all users have different needs, there’s no such thing as a fully ‘accessible’ font, but usually it’s better to choose a sans-serif font (such as Arial) over a serif font (such as Times New Roman).”

A Home Office spokesman said the page was first published in February 2022.

Times New Roman is a serif font, meaning it has extra strokes on the ends of the larger lines that make up the letters – sometimes referred to as “wings” or “feet.”
