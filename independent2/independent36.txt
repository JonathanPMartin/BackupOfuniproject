Scottish Parliament erupts with cheers as SNP pass Gender Reform bill
Scotland has become the first part of the UK to approve gender self-identification plans that some applauded as a “historic day for equality”, while others protested over the rights of women and girls.
The UK government has said it may block Scotland's controversial new gender recognition laws - but Holyrood has warned any attempt to do so would be “vigorously contested”.
MSPs backed the proposals by 86 to 39 in the final vote in the Scottish parliament, making it easier and less intrusive for individuals to legally change their gender, while extending the system of self-identification to 16- and 17-year-olds for the first time.
