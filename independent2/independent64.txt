 appears to have bowed to pressure from rebel Tory MPs to toughen up punishments for social media bosses who fail to protect children from harm online.
The PM was facing a major backbench rebellion as 50 MPs put their names to an amendment to the Online Safety Bill that would make tech chiefs criminally liable if they do not block minors from seeing damaging content.
Michelle Donelan has reached a deal with rebels after talks over the weekend, according to a source close to the culture secretary, allowing the PM to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.
