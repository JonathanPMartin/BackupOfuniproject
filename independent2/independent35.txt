Senior MPs and officials who caused trouble or came to blows with 
 have been recognised in the first New Year Honours list to be published since the ex-prime minister left Downing Street.
Conservative Julian Lewis, chair of parliament’s Intelligence and Security committee, and Labour’s 
, chair of the Commons Standards committee, have both been given knighthoods.
And former cabinet secretary Lord Sedwill – who was pushed out after a row with chief of staff 
 – has been made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.
