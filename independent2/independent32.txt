, according to a new poll.
The survey by YouGov found that 18 per cent of people feel unsafe in restaurants, public transport, or other spaces because of the virus.

Last month the Office for National Statistics published figures show that over summer 2022, around 2.5 million people reported long-term sickness as the main reason for not working. This was a significant rise on 2019, up from around 2 million in 2019.
In his Budget Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, announced a government review into the causes of rising levels of economic inactivity. The term refers to people who are neither in work nor seeking work, and is a separate measure from unemployment.
In its report published on Monday the IPPR said Covid-19 was clearly driving inactivity through people being both less willing and able to go into work.
It called on the government to take steps to boost vaccine take-up, arguing that driving up vaccination rates “would benefit individuals, the NHS as it faces this winter’s ‘flu crisis, and business and the economy more generally”. 
Recommendations include creating a legal right to time off to get vaccinated and sick pay in the event of side effects.

And they said a government health disinformation unit should be set up to combat the spread of misinformation about vaccines, including among young people.
Efua Poku-Amanfo, IPPR researcher and lead author of the report, said: “Vaccines are recognised as one of the most effective and cost-efficient health interventions ever created and save millions of lives every year, with over 100,000 deaths in the UK prevented by the Covid-19 vaccine in its first nine months.
