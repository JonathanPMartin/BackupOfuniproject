Rishi Sunak warns MPs will have to justify donations amid new revelations
 Westminster Accounts is new database of MPs’ outside earnings and donations - but questions remain over where some of the money is coming from 
Rishi Sunak 'fully supports' transparency and disclosing donations for MPs
 will have to “justify” their political 
 to their constituents following the latest round of revelations. 
Politicians “should be in no doubt that the public will pay close attention”, Downing Street also said. 
Amid concerns over a lack of transparency and where some of the money flowing into Westminster is coming from, the prime minister also warned MPs must keep to the rules on earnings outside parliament. The accounts show Theresa May is one of the highest earners in parliament, alongside shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer’s opposition to MPs second jobs.
