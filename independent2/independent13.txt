Albanian government accuses Tory minister of ‘verbally lynching’ country
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick accused of ‘shameful’ attempt at chasing votes with video clip 
 has been accused of verbally “lynching” 
 after he shared a video praised the work of UK officials trying to “get them back to Tirana.”
Albanian foreign minister Olta Xhacka said she was shocked by the language used by Mr Jenrick in the Home Office clip about removal of failed asylum seekers and offenders.
Saying it was a “shameful” attempt at chasing “miserable votes”, she tweeted: “A verbal lynching of a whole nation in language that sounds like the minister is declaring open season on Albanians.”
