With a career that has spanned nearly 50 years, it might be hard to pinpoint your favourite 
 moment. Maybe you remember her Bafta-winning performance as Mrs Mingott in Martin Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence? As the rude-shaped-turnip-appreciating Lady Whiteadder in Blackadder? Or as Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter franchise?
The Jewish, Labour-supporting actor has been outspoken about her politics since her days growing up in Oxford and studying at Cambridge university, so when it comes to interviews, she’s gold dust. She 
 how, erm, “sexually aroused” she was at first meting Sir Laurence Olivier and 
 how much he had “matured” since they first worked together. In October she told Radio 4 exactly what 
. And now she’s fronting 
 to get the 2030 World Cup held in a LGBTQ+ friendly host country, a campaign that has currently raised over £15K.
With that in mind, Margolyes has kindly offered to take your questions on whatever you like. So get thinking and post below by midday on Friday 30 December and we’ll print her answers on Friday 6 January 2023.
 This article was amended on 26 December 2022 to correct Margolyes’ place of education.
