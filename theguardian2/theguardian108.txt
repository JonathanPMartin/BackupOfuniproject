The Scottish secretary told MPs he would issue a section 35 order to stop the gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill from getting royal assent. Alister Jack acknowledged it was a 'significant decision' from Westminster to use section 35 of the Scotland Act, but insisted it was not an attack on devolution. He said he hoped the UK and Scottish governments could work together on a new bill. Jack added: 'The United Kingdom government does all we can to respect the devolution settlement and to resolve disputes'
