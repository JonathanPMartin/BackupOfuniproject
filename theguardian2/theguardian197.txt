The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, piled pressure on Rishi Sunak, criticising the prime minister over his handling of outstanding questions around Nadhim Zahawi’s taxes. Speaking at PMQs, Starmer said Sunak’s failure to sack the former chancellor showed 'how hopelessly weak he is'. Starmer also took a swipe at the prime minister's wife, linking his reluctance to take action against Zahawi to tax avoidance in his own family. Starmer said: 'We all know why the prime minister was reluctant to ask his party chair questions about family finances and tax avoidance.'
Sunak told MPs that he was committed to due process and an investigation into Zahawi's taxes was under way, accusing the Labour leader of 'political opportunism'. He also said the Labour leader lacked 'principles', arguing he himself resigned when he disagreed with Boris Johnson whereas Starmer spent years in former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s cabinet
