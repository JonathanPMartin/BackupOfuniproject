No 10 says NHS is getting 'funding it needs' and refuses to accept it is 'in crisis'
Earlier today the vice president of the 
 said ministers were in denial over the extent of problems facing hospital A&amp;E departments. (See 
 lobby briefing this morning the prime minister’s spokesperson tried to avoid sounding complacent, but he did claim the NHS has the funding it needs this winter. He told journalists:
We are confident we are providing the NHS with the funding it needs, as we did throughout the pandemic, to deal with these issues …
We have been upfront with the public, long in advance of this winter, that, because of the pandemic and the pressures it’s placed in the backlog of cases, that this would be an extremely challenging winter. And that is what we are seeing.
When it was put to him that the queues at A&amp;E departments showed that the 
 was not getting the funding it needed, the spokesperson did not accept that. He said the government had always said the post-pandemic NHS backlogs would increase before they started to come down. He went on:
We have continued to put billions of pounds of additional funding into the NHS – £7.5bn for adult social care and for delayed discharge over the next two years. And there’s £14.1bn in additional funding to improve urgent and emergency care and tackle the backlogs.
The spokesperson also refused to accept that the NHS was in crisis. Asked if PM thought the service was in crisis, the spokesperson said:
This is certainly an unprecedented challenge for the NHS, brought about by a number of factors.
Asked if healthy patients should be discharged into hotels to free up beds in hospitals (an idea proposed by 
in an article for the Daily Mail today)
, the spokesperson said the NHS was already “maximising its number of beds”. The equivalent of an extra 7,000 beds had been freed up, he said.
The spokesperson also dismissed a suggestion that because
 Rishi Sunak and his family use private healthcare
, he was not aware of the problems with the NHS. It was “wholly wrong” to say he was not aware of the problems the service was facing, he said.
Asked if Sunak would be happy for his family to have to rely on NHS services, the spokesperson said he would not discuss the PM’s family’s healthcare.
I will post more from the briefing soon.

I don’t think there is a big appetite to turn on Rishi [Sunak]. We’ve got two years. We’ve had a record number of prime ministers in one year.

Davis also told the station the Tories had a “good chance” of winning the next election. But he corrected himself. “Good’s too strong. We’ve got a chance of winning,” he said.
 has promised Ukraine further military equipment in the next few weeks, No 10 said this afternoon. Sunak made the pledge in a call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. In its readout of the conversation, No 10 said:
The leaders discussed the abhorrent drone attacks on Ukraine in recent days, and the prime minister said the thoughts of the UK were with the Ukrainian people as they continued to live under such bombardment.
The prime minister said Ukraine could count on the UK to continue to support it for the long term, as demonstrated by the recent delivery of more than 1,000 anti-air missiles.
Work was also under way to provide further equipment in the coming weeks and months to secure Ukraine’s victory on the battlefield, the prime minister added.

Whether it’s our immediate neighbourhood with access to good quality local urban spaces, or village greens, a lot of people actually are denied access to that immediate recreational space, and I think we can do far more. I’m fortunate enough to live near an urban country park. And for me that is our little slice of nature, our little slice of the environment, and we care passionately about it and every one of my neighbours does too. I want the same for every part of the country.
In the interview, McMahon strongly rejected the idea that, because he did not have a rural background, he would not be an advocate for farmers. And he said that two previous environment secretaries he admired were Michael Gove, because he gave Defra “status and a sense of purpose”, and Michael Meacher, because he delivered the right to roam. He said the next Labour manifesto would include plans to extend the right to roam, but the details had not yet been finalised.

DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson says 'fundamental change of attitude' needed from EU on NI protocol
, the DUP leader, has said that a “fundamental change of attitude” is needed from the EU to secure an agreement on reform of the 
 issued in response to Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, saying the original protocol was too strict (see
The protocol was not, is not and will not be supported by unionists.
It was a mistake for its authors to press ahead with an agreement that has harmed Northern Ireland’s constitutional and economic place within the United Kingdom.
Whilst Mr Varadkar’s comments indicate he now recognises the political reality in Northern Ireland, we need to see a fundamental change of attitude in the negotiations if we are to see an outcome that is durable.
, Donaldson is right to say that unionists do not support the protocol – although there is a huge difference between people who identify as strongly unionist, who mostly fiercely oppose the protocol, and people who identify as only slightly unionist, who still object to it, but less vigorously.

Continued train strikes 'self-defeating' for rail industry because passengers won't return, says No 10
The Times this morning splashes on a story saying the government is worried that the rail strikes could deter people from travelling by train for good. The line is attributed to a government source, 
 “This is an act of self-harm — a generation of passengers will just write off the railways.”
Tuesday&#39;s Times: Millions &#39;will shun trains for the ever&#39; 
At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson confirmed that this was the government’s view. He said:
Certainly we do believe that, when it comes to rail, this course of action is self-defeating. Following the pandemic 40% of commuters haven’t returned to the railways. Continued strike action, as the transport secretary said this morning, is not the way that you get people back onto trains.
No 10 refuses to say if it agrees with Pannick's criticisms of privileges committee's inquiry into Johnson
Last year Lord Pannick KC and a fellow barrister, Jason Pobjoy, published 
saying the parliamentary inquiry into claims that Boris Johnson misled MPs over Partygate was flawed. Downing Street paid almost £130,000 for the advice, on the grounds that it relates to what Johnson told MPs in his capacity as PM.
Before Christmas it emerged that Pannick has submitted a second submission to the privileges committee, which is carrying out the inquiry. This one has not yet been published, but it is understood that Pannick is again arguing 
that Johnson is not getting a fair hearing
At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson was asked if No 10 agreed with the advice provided by Pannick that it has paid for. The spokesperson sidestepped the question, saying that parliament set up the inquiry and that it was for parliament to decide what was appropriate for the the privileges committee to be doing.
At the lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson was unable to say when the proposed legislation to reform asylum rules, or the results of the inquiry into the Dominic Raab bullying allegations, would be published.
No 10 fails to deny that Truss's childcare overhaul now being scaled back
Yesterday the Daily Telegraph splashed on 
 saying Rishi Sunak has abandoned Liz Truss’s plans for a major overhaul of childcare rules. Truss wanted to relax the mandatory staff-child ratios, in the hope that this would bring down costs.
Liz Truss had been looking at increasing free childcare support by 20 hours a week and ending mandated staff-child ratios in what her team described as a “big bang” 
But the Telegraph understands the policy drive has been postponed indefinitely, with the scale of reforms now being considered expected to be much smaller.
Any proposed changes to the rules around childcare provision are not expected for months – a much later timescale than Ms Truss’s push for announcements before Christmas.
 lobby briefing if the report was accurate, the PM’s spokesperson said Sunak was still committed to childcare reform. But he did not sound very keen on the Truss version of this policy. He told journalists:
We’re certainly continuing to review all options to improve the costs, choice and availability of high-quality childcare for working parents. It’s very important for this prime minister, as is education … Obviously we’d update in the normal way.
At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said full details of the requirement for people flying to the UK from China 
to have a negative Covid test
 would be published “in due course”. Under the current plans, only mainland China is covered and Hong Kong is excluded. But the spokesperson said this issue would be addressed in the update.
No 10 says it has 'no plans' to put back deadline for retained EU law to expire, but does not rule out this happening
At the lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said that there were “no plans” to change the deadline in 
the retained EU law (recovation and reform) bill
 saying that most retained EU regulations will expire by the end of 2023, unless ministers have decided following a review to retain or replace them. Around 
But when the spokesperson was asked if that meant there was no prospect of the deadline being delayed, he just said there were “no plans” for this to happen.
The questions were prompted by 
 saying the government would agree to put back the 2023 deadline – which has been widely criticised as unrealistic (because government departments reportedly do not have the capacity to review all these rules properly before the end of the year).
But the Times story by 
 did not say No 10 would unilaterally agree to extend the deadline. Swinford said this was expected to happen in response to a defeat, or a threatened defeat, in the House of Lords. He said:
A senior government source told the Times that it was “inevitable” that the government would have to abandon its plans when the legislation reaches the Lords, which is expected to be next month. Peers have raised significant concerns about them.
“I can’t see it [the deadline] surviving,” the source said. “We’ll have to compromise when it gets to the Lords. If the object is to review all these regulations properly rather than just cut and paste them into UK law then 
. It’s an entirely arbitrary deadline. We’re going to have to make a concession to get it through.”
There was nothing in what the No 10 spokesperson said this morning to suggest this was not a plausible, or likely, scenario.
No 10 welcomes Irish PM's admission original Northern Ireland protocol 'perhaps little bit too strict'
Downing Street has welcomed the admission from Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM), that the original 
 protocol was “perhaps … a little bit too strict”. Asked about his comment, the PM’s spokesperson said:
We’ve said for some time now that we’ve always felt that it was possible to enact the protocol in a way that was flexible, and so obviously those are welcome, those comments.
We will still discussing at official level ways we can reach a resolution.
