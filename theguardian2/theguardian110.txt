Tory West Midlands mayor condemns way levelling up fund operates, saying 'bidding and begging bowl culture is broken'
, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, and the most senior Tory in local government, has delivered a withering assessment of the way the levelling up fund operates.
He says that most of the bids from the West Midlands were rejected, that some of its most deprived areas lost out and that it should be for local decision makers, not Whitehall, to decide where money gets spent.
He says this shows ‚Äúwhy Whitehall‚Äôs bidding and begging bowl culture is broken and the sooner we can decentralise and move to proper fiscal devolution the better‚Äù.

Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, has delivered a damning assessment of the way the government administers its levelling up fund. 
He was speaking as the government announced how 111 communities would receive funding worth a total of ¬£2.1bn from the fund. This is the second round of awards from the fund, which is worth ¬£4.8bn in total. Echoing Labour criticisms of the way local authorities are forced to bid for money from central government, Street said today‚Äôs announcements showed ‚Äúwhy Whitehall‚Äôs bidding and begging bowl culture is broken, and the sooner we can decentralise and move to proper fiscal devolution the better‚Äù.

Starmer calls for 'clean power alliance' of leading net zero countries as alternative to Opec
 has called for a ‚Äúclean power alliance‚Äù of countries strongly committed to net zero as an alternative to Opec, the cartel of oil producing states.
Speaking at Davos, he said an alliance of this kind could operate as an ‚Äúinverse Opec‚Äù. He explained:
One of the things that I am proposing is a clean power alliance where countries that are in the advance when it comes to net-zero share information, cooperate and share investment with a view to driving the global prices down.
So, this is an inverse Opec, if you like. Instead of trying to ensure prices stay at a certain level, it‚Äôs to drive them down, to see the common benefit, whether it‚Äôs in the UK or across the globe.
If we could get that alliance working together, then I think that will be a big step in the right direction.

Starmer says Met police need 'root and branch' changes, possibly including new name
 need ‚Äúroot and branch‚Äù changes, which might need to include changing its name.
In an interview with the News Agents podcast, Starmer said that having a new name might help to assure Londoners that the force had been through a genuine transformation.
He said having a new title was one reason why the 
 Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has more public support than its predecessor body in Northern Ireland, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).
, who has admitted multiple counts of rape committed while he was a police officer in the Met, showed a ‚Äúfundamental review‚Äù of the force was needed. He said:
It absolutely needs fundamental review. The Carrick case is just jaw-droppingly shocking. But it‚Äôs obviously not a single case on its own. There are other examples, many of which we‚Äôve seen in the last few years.
It needs a root and branch review, cultural change, because this is not just the perpetrators, it‚Äôs those that have allowed this to happen, moved them around, not taken action when they should have done.
When he was a barrister, Starmer served as a human rights adviser to the board overseeing thePSNI, the then new force set up after the Good Friday agreement to replace the RUC, which did not have the confidence of the Catholic community it served. He said:
With the police service in Northern Ireland ‚Ä¶ that was root and branch, that was stripping it down.
It was also very important that it was called the Police Service of Northern Ireland because it changed the way in which the force was looking, it was a service to the public, not a police force.
Asked if the Met should also change its name, he replied:
If changing the name signals a change, then perhaps. It was very important to what we were trying to achieve in Northern Ireland that it was the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
Sunak apologises for not wearing seatbelt while filming social media video
 has apologised for making a ‚Äúbrief error of judgment‚Äù by removing his seatbelt to film a social media video message while a passenger in the back seat of a car. PA Media says:
No belt could be seen covering the prime minister‚Äôs shoulder as he promoted his levelling up funding in the clip filmed for Instagram on Thursday as he visited Lancashire.
Fines of up to ¬£500 can be issued for failing to wear a seatbelt when one is available.
There are a few exemptions, including when a car is being used for police, fire and rescue services and for certified medical issues.
Police motorbikes can be seen escorting the car as Sunak addresses the camera.
Lancashire constabulary referred a request for comment to the Metropolitan police.
The government has considered toughening seatbelt rules to ensure drivers not wearing them could receive penalty points.
Recent Department for Transport figures suggested around 30% of people killed in cars on Britain‚Äôs roads in 2021 were unrestrained.
Later a Downing Street spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThat was a brief error of judgment. The prime minister removed his seatbelt to film a short clip.‚Äù
Sunak ‚Äúfully accepts this was a mistake and apologises‚Äù, the spokesperson added.
‚ÄúThe prime minister believes everyone should wear a seatbelt. It was an error of judgment, he removed it for a short period of time to film a clip, which you‚Äôve seen, but he accepts that was a mistake.‚Äù

What Sunak said about not being able to cut taxes now, but wanting to be able to cut them in future
Here is the full quote from 
 during the Q&amp;A, when he was talking about cutting taxes and explaining why people knew it could not happen now because they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúidiots‚Äù.
He did not mention Liz Truss, but he referred to her when he said that over the summer people saw what happened when politicians made unrealistic promises.
I‚Äôm a Conservative. I want to cut your taxes, of course I do, because you will work incredibly hard, and I want you to keep more of your money so you can spend on the stuff that you want to. That‚Äôs what I want to deliver.
I wish I could do that tomorrow, quite frankly. But the reason we can‚Äôt is because all the reasons, you know. You‚Äôre not idiots, you know what‚Äôs happened.
We had a massive pandemic for two years, we had to shut the country down, do a bunch of extraordinary things ‚Äì that didn‚Äôt come cheap. And we‚Äôve got this war going on, which is having an enormous impact on inflation and interest rates.
And that‚Äôs meant that the public finances ‚Äì how much we borrow every year and the trajectory of our debt ‚Äì is not where it needs to be.
And the worst thing I could do is promise you a bunch of things that sound great, but ultimately just make the situation worse. And all of you guys in the front couple of rows here [students] are just going to have to have to pick up the tab. I don‚Äôt want to do that.
My job is to make sure that when you get all these fantastic jobs that we were talking about, that I‚Äôve left you a really strong economy where, yes, we‚Äôre going to be able to fund the NHS and schools and all the other things that we talked about, but at that point interest rates are coming back down, you can afford to buy a house because the mortgages are not too expensive, inflation we‚Äôve got a grip of ‚Ä¶ And then, yes, we can cut your taxes so you can keep more of what you earn.
But it takes a bit of work to get there. And, as you saw over the summer, the easiest thing in the world is me to just promise you the Earth. But I wouldn‚Äôt be being straight with you.
But, trust me, that is what I‚Äôm going to do for you this year. That is what we are going to do while I‚Äôm prime minister. And if we do those things, we will be able to cut your taxes. That‚Äôs what I want to deliver.

Starmer criticises Sunak for not attending Davos, saying UK has been absent on global stage in recent yearas
 has criticised Rishi Sunak for not attending the World Economic Forum event at Davos. Responding to a question at a panel event, Starmer said:
Yes, I think our prime minister should have showed up at Davos.
One of the things that‚Äôs been impressed on me since I‚Äôve been here is the absence of the United Kingdom.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs really important that I‚Äôm here and that our shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is here ‚Äì as a statement of intent that, should there be a change of government, and I hope there will be, the United Kingdom will play its part on the global stage in a way I think it probably hasn‚Äôt in recent years.

There was lots of anger in Nottingham today as it was revealed the Midlands city missed out on the government‚Äôs latest round of levelling up funding.
The city had submitted three bids, including one to help turn the 
 into a performance and food space, totalling ¬£57m, but all three were rejected.
 MP for Nottingham North and shadow levelling up minister, said the announcement was ‚Äújust the latest instalment of disappointment from the government on levelling up‚Äù.
He told the local democracy reporting service:
It‚Äôs exceptionally disappointing to see that our city‚Äôs bids have not succeeded. The government has no interest in supporting Nottingham.
Nevertheless our ideas are good ones and we will keep fighting to see them become reality.
The Nottingham city council leader, 
 said it was ‚Äúa big disappointment‚Äù the bids had been turned down when the city ‚Äúso clearly needs‚Äù levelling up funding. He said:
All three Nottingham bids were very strong and clearly aligned to what the Levelling Up Fund is meant to be about. There has been huge support for the exciting new vision for Broad Marsh we unveiled just over a year ago.
Mellen said the council would ‚Äúexplore alternative public and private funding options‚Äù so the plans can still go ahead.
Sunak says people understand why government cannot cut taxes now because they're 'not idiots'
The most significant moment in Rishi Sunak‚Äôs Q&amp;A came when he said that people understand why the government cannot cut taxes now because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not idiots‚Äù.
It was a throwaway remark, and it came in the course of an answer in which Sunak stressed his belief in low taxes, and his determination to cut taxes eventually, but it probably set alarm bells ringing in the No 10 media operation.
Thursday&#39;s Mail: Cut Taxes Or Lose Election, Tories Warned 
The Mail splash, and its editorial, were prompted by my colleague Pippa Crerar‚Äôs story yesterday saying that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, is planning 
a slimmed down budget that will not contain tax cuts.
, the Mail quotes Tory MPs alarmed by this news. It says:
 said: ‚ÄòWe have got to get growth going. This Government will sink without trace if we don‚Äôt get growth going by the middle of this year ‚Äì we won‚Äôt have a hope of winning the election. We are already over-taxed and it is quite clear we cannot tax ourselves out of a recession.‚Äô
 also warned tax cuts were essential ‚Äì and said some could even boost overall revenues by triggering growth. He added: ‚ÄòWe cannot address the issue of growth without some tax cuts. They must be affordable, of course ‚Äì but the best way to bring borrowing down and boost revenues is to grow the economy.‚Äô
The Mail also says that Sunak‚Äôs two predecessors as PM, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, both want taxes cut.
In his Q&amp;A, when asked about tax cuts, 
When I was chancellor I also really preferred it when the prime minister didn‚Äôt comment on tax policy.
I‚Äôm a Conservative, I want to cut your taxes ‚Ä¶ I wish I could do that tomorrow, quite frankly, but the reason we can‚Äôt is because of all the reasons you know. You‚Äôre not idiots, you know what‚Äôs happened.
Sunak said the pandemic and the war in Ukraine had left the public finances ‚Äúnot where it needs to be‚Äù. He said that he wanted to get a ‚Äúgrip‚Äù on inflation, get interest rates down and make the economy stronger, so that the NHS and schools can be well funded. He went on:
Trust me, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do for you this year, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do while I‚Äôm prime minister and if we do those things we will be able to cut your taxes.
When Sunak used the word ‚Äúidiots‚Äù, he almost certainly did not intend to refer to Tory colleagues like Iain Duncan Smith and John Redwood. But his comment could be linked to them quite easily, which makes it potentially perilous.

Meanwhile, hostilities between the two governments continue, with Holyrood‚Äôs social justice secretary,

This legislation is designed to make trans people‚Äôs lives better by removing an administrative burden. Instead, trans people have been dragged into an attack on devolution that puts them in the middle of a continuing culture war. The UK government must rethink this damaging course of action.
