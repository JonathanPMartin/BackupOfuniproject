'Anya Taylor-Joy single-handedly shut down Noma with her performance': The Menu fans joke that the film is responsible for the closing of the world's best restaurant

The Menu fans are joking that the film is responsible for closing down one of the world's most creative restaurants, after its chef announced it would be closing its doors in 2023.
Rene Redzepi, 45, is widely considered one of the world's top chefs and thanks to his kitchen alchemy Noma has been named the world's best restaurant five times and boasts three Michelin stars.
He said his Copenhagen flagship restaurant, which first opened in 2003, will become a giant test kitchen, dubbed Noma 3.0, in 2024 - only opening in 2025 for short periods at a time.
Hilarious: The Menu fans are joking that the film is responsible for closing down one of the world's most creative restaurants, after its chef announced it would be closing its doors in 2023
, he said the 'unsustainable' nature of the global fine dining scene - which commands long hours in the kitchen and painstakingly high standards, along with the pandemic had helped him make the decision to shut up shop. 
However, the internet has different ideas, and says that the Ralph Fiennes' movie The Menu is to blame.

The dark comedy centres on a couple played by Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult, who travel to a remote island to eat at an exclusive restaurant run by pretentious chef Slowik (Ralph).
Impressive: Rene Redzepi, 45, is widely considered one of the world's top chefs and thanks to his kitchen alchemy Noma has been named the world's best restaurant five times and boasts three Michelin stars
Closing: He said his Copenhagen flagship restaurant, which first opened in 2003, will become a giant test kitchen, dubbed Noma 3.0, in 2024 - only opening in 2025 for short periods at a time
Slowik present outlandish food dishes, such as a 'Breadless Bread Plate', 'Chicken Tacos with Scissors in it' and, for the finale, 'Smore's'.
The film is a satire about the over-the-top ridiculousness of food and drink today, but also the class politics and elitism that often comes with it. 
The movie was released late last year, and just became available online on Disney+ and HBO Max this month, after which Noma announced it would be closing down.

Fans are now joking that The Menu was 'the nail in the coffin for Noma' and at fault for Rene's decision, and are taking to Twitter to voice their amusement.
One said: 'The Menu comes out on HBO Max and a day later the Noma guy announces he is closing the restaurant lol'.
Another echoed: 'I firmly believe Rene Redzepi saw The Menu and realized that’s what ppl thought of Noma and was like “we’re DONE” and that’s why Noma is closing'.
A third agreed, writing: 'The Menu comes out on HBO Max, next week later Noma shuts down. sometimes correlation does equal causation'.
A fourth quipped: 'i can’t believe the menu (2022) singlehandedly shut down noma', while another praised: 'anya taylor joy single-handedly shut down Noma with her performance in the menu'.
Someone else wrote: 'noma chef saw The Menu and said welp it's time to go', while another person joked: 'you think the cia maybe put The Menu on streaming right before Noma went outta biz on purpose?' 
And one Twitter user pointed out: 'Watching The Menu yesterday and seeing Noma is closing today... hard not to link these two in my mind'.
While another added: 'my theory is that rené redzepi watched the menu and subsequently decided to shut down noma'.
