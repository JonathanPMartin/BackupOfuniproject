 are set to face a new onslaught from the Sussexes in the shape of a memoir by 
After the couple delivered a salvo of explosive claims in their recent 
's new autobiography Spare is expected to stir up yet further controversy.
The series' allegations of racism and unfair treatment of Meghan have left the Royal Family reeling, and the situation seems certain to worsen with the publication of Harry's book in nine days' time.
But now reports have emerged that Meghan is to publish her own bombshell memoir.
The Duchess of Sussex, pictured with her husband, is planning to write her own autobiography which will leave 'no stone unturned' about life as a royal according to sources in Hollywood
Prince Harry's book, Spare, is due to be released on Tuesday, January 10
Nearly HALF the British public want Prince Harry to be...
Why an over-sized suit is the new royal must-have! Princess...
According to one source, the Duchess of Sussex 'is contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the Royal limelight… and leaving no stone unturned'.
In 2021 the couple reportedly signed a four-book deal with publishers Penguin Random House.
Prince Harry is said to have received a $20 million advance for Spare. Meghan has already released her children's book The Bench with the same publisher, and it is rumoured that the couple are working on a 'wellness' book. Now it is believed the mystery fourth book will be Meghan's autobiography.
A bestselling memoir would put Meghan in a well-trodden American political tradition, amid much speculation that she may have ambitions for elected office, given her outspoken views on women's rights and other issues.
A Hollywood agent told The Mail on Sunday: 'I would find it surprising if Meghan didn't publish her own story, to be honest. Spare is clearly Prince Harry's chance to tell his, but hers is equally compelling. I mean, how many actresses end up marrying a Prince?'
The source added: 'If she's harbouring political ambitions it would make even more sense,' pointing out that Presidents Clinton, Obama and Trump all wrote books setting out their beliefs before launching bids for the White House.

The Duchess, a Democrat, has become close to America's 'political royalty', the Kennedy family, and was honoured last month alongside her husband with an award from the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights non-profit organisation.
The organisation's leader Kerry Kennedy – niece of former US president John F. Kennedy – said the Sussexes received the award for their stand against 'structural racism' within the Royal Family.
Meghan is also good friends with feminist icon Gloria Steinem who is still closely involved in liberal politics. A friend of Ms Steinem's said: 'Meghan has strong views very much in alignment with Gloria's in terms of social justice and women's rights. Gloria is encouraging her to make her voice heard.'
But some have warned that the Sussexes may be in danger of overexposure.
One senior Hollywood executive said: 'We've had the Oprah Winfrey interview, then the Netflix series and now we've got Harry's book. You have to ask if the world really needs to hear Meghan's story right now? If I was advising her I would caution against releasing a book too quickly because there is a very real danger that people will start experiencing 'Sussex fatigue'.
'There comes a point where people might feel they've heard the same stories too many times. They have to change the narrative at some stage and focus on the future rather than past transgressions.'
Meanwhile, Harry's book has been billed as being written with 'raw, unflinching honesty'.
The Duke is set to launch a publicity blitz next Sunday with an interview on America's flagship 60 Minutes show.
He will also be interviewed by ITV's Tom Bradby in the UK.
Abroad, Harry is The Other or Spare Wheel! 
It is  one of the most eagerly anticipated books of 2023, but despite the dramatic title, In The Shadow isn't the latest bestseller from Harlan Coben or Lee Child.
In fact En La Sombra is the Spanish translation of Prince Harry's memoir, Spare. The title refers to his role as a spare Prince, unlike William who is heir to the throne.
In addition to its English editions, the book – due out on January 10 – has been translated into 15 other languages. The Dutch, Romanian and German editions translate the title as Reserve, while the Greek translation can also be the word for a car's spare wheel.
The French title is Le Suppleant – or Substitute, while in Italian it is subtitled Il Minore – The Minor or The Younger.
Sweden's version is Den Andre – The Second or The Other. Likewise, in Poland it is Ten Drugi – The Other One. Poignantly, in Brazil it is What's Left Over.
Prince Harry's book has been translated into different languages for the international market
