Following a board meeting on Wednesday, the IOC announced a proposal for athletes from Russia and Belarus to enter Olympic qualification events in Asia rather than Europe, as long as they do no compete under their respective country's flag and have not actively supported the war.

The IOC announced a proposal for Russia and Belarus athletes to enter qualification events in Asia
Pressure group Global Athlete said: 'Today's decision sends a message to the world that the IOC endorses Russia's brutal war and invasion of Ukraine. By allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete, the IOC is strengthening Russia's propaganda machine, empowering the Putin regime, and undermining peace.
'The IOC is allowing the Games to be used for sportwashing - to normalise, legitimise, and distract from the war. As a servant of Russia, the IOC continues to be on the wrong side of history with this decision that favours politics over principle and war over peace.'
