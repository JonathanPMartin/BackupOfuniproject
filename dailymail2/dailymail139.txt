DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Labour serves either the unions... or voters

A major ingredient in the brew with which 
 made New Labour electable was the way he kept his party’s paymasters at arm’s length.
A quarter of a century on, those militants have returned, flexing their muscles and trying to dominate British politics. This is a huge challenge to our democracy – and one that Sir 
, who aspires to be prime minister, is flunking hopelessly.
Strikes have brought trains to a standstill. Nurses and ambulance crews walk out this month. Teachers, civil servants and fire crews are also expected to picket.
To secure unaffordable, inflation-busting salary rises, the hard-Left barons are happy for millions of commuters, patients, school children and businesses to suffer.

One in six firms say they are suffering from the impact of...
Anti-strike laws to enforce 'minimum safety' levels:...
So we welcome the Government’s plan to introduce legislation to guarantee a minimum service during strikes in crucial sectors, including the railways, NHS and education. It will also let employers sue unions for damages and sack striking staff.
Of course, the devil is in the detail – and unions are already screaming blue murder. However, nothing ministers propose is unreasonable. Indeed, some say it is far too reasonable. 
And if the Lords – with an in-built Left-wing majority – block them, Rishi Sunak must force the laws through.
Predictably, Sir Keir vowed to oppose the curbs, despite not even seeing them. Yet his party won’t bite the hand that feeds it.
But people are getting utterly sick of disruption. When they go to the polls, they know Labour MPs will not serve those who send them to Parliament – but the unions that hold their purse strings.
What a supreme irony that Sir Keir, an evangelical Remainer, is now mimicking the language of Brexit.
Grudgingly accepting that Boris Johnson inspired millions of Labour supporters to vote Tory, he says he wants to help local communities ‘take back control’.
Yet not long ago, he was so appalled by the public’s decision to regain sovereignty from the EU that he was at the vanguard of the campaign to block it.
Under all the flummery, has the Corbyn-backing lawyer (aka Captain Crasheroonie Snoozefest) really changed his spots?
Keir Starmer insists he will not get out the ‘big government chequebook’. Yet imagine the taxes required to pay for the new army of Left-wing politicians and administrators
Do we really need more ultra-localism? So far devolution has led to Labour lightweights such as Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham becoming city mayors. While constantly showboating on the airwaves, they do nothing to advance their citizens’ lives.
Sir Keir insists he will not get out the ‘big government chequebook’. Yet imagine the taxes required to pay for the new army of Left-wing politicians and administrators.
Of course, none of this will help solve the key problems Mr Sunak outlined – including flatlining growth and uncontrolled migration. It’s nothing more than a distraction from the fact Labour’s leader is an ocean-going dud with no answers.
It is a sad fact that all families fall out. But Prince Harry’s thirst for revenge against any Windsor he believes has been inconsiderate, crass or disloyal is truly staggering.
For someone pathologically obsessed with protecting his privacy, no moment is too intimate for the Duke of Sussex to dredge up as part of his vendetta.
In an extraordinary litany of score-settling in his memoir, Harry claims his brother William manhandled him and snapped his necklace during a fraternal bust-up.
He blabs about King Charles looking for a fight with him at Prince Philip’s funeral. And despite bleating about his own security, he talks unedifyingly of killing the Taliban in Afghanistan – making him more of a target.
With a stunning lack of awareness, Harry says he wants to reconcile with his family. But to start on that painful path, he must end the tawdry and upsetting accusations.
