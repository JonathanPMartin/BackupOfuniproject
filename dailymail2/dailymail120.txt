The singer, 37, who is the daughter of actor 
 and film producer Alison Owen, voiced her opinions on 'nepotism babies', which refers to children born into affluent or famous families.
Lily - whose brother Alfie, 36, is an actor - claimed the nepotism babies that people should be 'worried about' are the ones working for 'legal firms, banks and in politics'.

She took to Twitter to hit back at the criticism of nepotism babies in the entrainment industry and claimed it is not a 'parent friendly' business and said these children can be 'starved' of 'love'.
In her online rant, she said: 'The nepo babies y'all should be worrying about are the ones working for legal firms, the ones working for banks, and the ones working in politics.
'If we're talking about real world consequences and robbing people of opportunity. BUT that's none of my business.'
'And before you come at me for being a nepo baby myself, I will be the first to tell you that I literally deserve nothing,' she added.

When a Twitter user asked her, 'Why are your parents blue links on Wikipedia,' she replied: 'Because I'm a nepo baby, and both my parents are super talented.' 
Lily went on to claim that the entertainment industry is not 'parent friendly' and said it can be hard to 'see one's own privilege' when 'processing childhood trauma'. 
She continued: 'In childhood we crave stability and love, nurturing, we don't care about money or proximity to power yet. 
'Many of the nepo babies are starved of these basic things in childhood as their parents are probably narcissistic.
'And entertainment business is not parent friendly eg.. Touring/months away shooting. 
'We crave stability and love': She claimed the entrainment industry is not a 'parent friendly' business and said nepotism babies can be 'starved' of 'basic things'
'It can be hard to see one's own privilege when you're still processing childhood trauma, and a lot of these kids haven't figured that out yet.'
It is not the first time that 
 as she previously ranted about her father Keith when addressing the issue back in 2015.
According to the Daily Mirror, she was involved in an exchange on Twitter when she posted lyrics to Faces Song, Ooh La La, which read 'I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger'.
In the posts from 2015, one user replied: 'What, that you really are talentless and only 'famous' off the back of Daddy... bore off!' 
Hitting back: Lily, whose brother Alfie, 36, (pictured) is an actor, said it can be hard to 'see one's own privilege' when 'processing childhood trauma'
Lily reportedly hit back with: 'My dad walked out on me when I was 4, I'm sick of this. My dad was at Latitude when I headlined and didn't even come to see me.
'I've probably spent more time walking my dogs than I have with my dad my entire life. And I'm 30, too old to be running to anyone.'
The Smile hitmaker has previously said she would spend weekends in the hotel room above the Groucho club as a child, with a Toblerone to keep her going.
In previous interviews, she also revealed that the ending of her parents' marriage in 1989 left her insecure and desperately craving attention.
Split: In previous interviews, Lily (pictured with her father Keith in 2007) also revealed that the ending of her parents' marriage in 1989 left her insecure and desperately craving attention 
Her father Keith has had six children with four women and Lily was partly raised by her former stepfather, comedian Harry Enfield.
Lily said: 'One of my earliest memories is of when Mum and Dad split up. We were in our council flat in Bloomsbury and Dad was saying: 'Me and Mum are splitting up now.'
'I was about four and I was thinking: 'Does that mean we've got to look for a new dad?' It was very hard for Mum. She was producing her first film and my younger brother, Alfie, was a difficult kid.
'I just lived within my own brain. I had this blanket and I'd suck my thumb and watch the world go by.'
Father: Last year, Lily also detailed her strained relationship with her father Keith (pictured in 2007) and admitted they 'haven't spoken in a while'
 and admitted they 'haven't spoken in a while'.
She told The Telegraph: 'I haven't really spoken to him, to be honest, for a while. 
'The last time I texted him was on Father's Day and he texted back saying 'Thank you.' We haven't connected for a while.'
In 2018, Lily said Keith had been left fuming when she claimed he'd suffered a 'cocaine-induced heart attack' at Glastonbury festival when she was 13 - when really it was acute food poisoning.
Lily confessed: 'I got quite a cross text from him this weekend. There was a big piece [in the press] and he texted me, 'Err cocaine induced heart attack at Glastonbury. Wow'.
'And I said, 'Sorry that's what I thought… I'm really sorry if I got that wrong but that's how I remembered it and you never explained it to me in any other way so that's what I wrote' and he said, 'Well that's not true.'
Upset: In previous interviews, she also revealed that the ending of her parents' marriage in 1989 left her insecure and desperately craving attention
And I said, 'I'm really really sorry if I got that wrong, what was it?' And he said, 'Acute food poisoning'.'
On her bond with her dad, she added: 'I was close with him and in my teenage years I really wanted to forge a relationship with him so I used to go and watch Fulham play every Saturday with him and his mates and things were really good at a certain point.'
Lily shares two daughters - Marnie, nine, and Ethel, 11 - with her ex Sam Cooper and she is married to Stranger Things actor David Harbour.
