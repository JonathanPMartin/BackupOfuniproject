DOMINIC SANDBROOK: War, inflation and three Prime Ministers. Who knows what's coming next? But let's raise a glass to better days in 2023!

How will history remember the past 12 months? For many of us, 2022 will always be the year that brought an end to the longest reign in British history: a year of mourning and 
, as we bade farewell to our late Queen, Elizabeth II, the embodiment of patriotic duty.
It was also the year of the Russian 
, which blew away any lingering illusions about everlasting peace and prosperity in the post-Cold War era.
Indeed, as we watched the appalling images of slaughter and destruction — as well as the inspirational scenes of Ukrainian heroism against overwhelming odds — it often felt as if we’d been catapulted back to the early 1940s, when another brutal dictator sought to bend Europe to his will.
By contrast, Rishi Sunak is a much smoother public performer, which is why he was left wearing the crown at the end of the year

Taking an even longer view, 2022 will probably be remembered as a year that dealt a colossal shock to the Western capitalist model. Here, in Britain, rocketing oil and gas prices saw inflation reach 11.1 per cent, while official forecasts suggest that we’re heading into the longest recession since records began.
If you’d been living on a desert island for the past 12 months, you might wonder what on earth could eclipse such seismic events in the public imagination. The answer, of course, is the most colourful and chaotic show in town — the great pantomime of Westminster politics.
The Romans remembered AD69, the year that followed the death of the tyrannical Nero, as the Year of the Four Emperors, as rival generals battled for power. And for as long as the Palace of Westminster still stands, people will surely remember 2022 as the Year of the Three Prime Ministers.
From the high drama of Boris Johnson’s fall to the low comedy of Liz Truss’s 49-day premiership, from the lurid allegations about Downing Street parties to a winter of crippling public sector strikes, it has been a political year like no other.
And despite the pantomime analogy, it is worth remembering that what happens in Westminster and Whitehall has serious real-world consequences — people struggling to pay their gas bills, families marooned by cancelled trains, pensioners left waiting for hours in the cold for an ambulance.
Still, the reason so many of us are interested in politics is that it often has a soap-opera quality. And although the political crises of 2022 had deep structural roots — the political legacy of Brexit, for example, or the inflationary shock of the war in Ukraine — there’s no denying the fascination of such anarchic and implausible characters.
Future biographers will surely have a field day with Boris Johnson, a man with a remarkable gift for winning elections and appealing to apolitical voters; but also, by all accounts, a shambolic administrator who was eventually brought down by his own character flaws.
So much has happened in the past few months that it’s easy to forget that, as recently as June 6, Mr Johnson actually won a vote of confidence in his leadership. But with four out of ten of his own MPs voting against him, the writing was on the wall.
When he ill-advisedly tried to defend his deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who had been accused of multiple instances of sexual harassment, the game was up.
So many ministers rushed to resign that, by the end, nobody knew who was still in Government and who wasn’t. In an especially baroque development, Michelle Donelan assumed office as Education Secretary on 5 July only to quit two days later, becoming the shortest-serving Cabinet minister in British history.
And when Boris was finally dragged kicking and screaming from No 10, the drama was far from over. This, of course, was merely the cue for a seven-week leadership election and then, almost unbelievably, a seven-week premiership.
Unlike Boris, it’s hard to see Liz Truss attracting the attention of many future historians — except perhaps as an object lesson in ideological hubris and reckless incompetence.
What doomed her, though, wasn’t just her friend Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrously ill-judged mini-Budget, with its sweeping tax cuts and blithe insouciance about the reaction of the markets.
It was Ms Truss’s glaring deficiencies as a public speaker and her total inability to cope with interviewers’ questions, which meant that she never properly set out what she was trying to do.
That’s a reminder, I think, that in politics, performance really, really matters. If you can’t explain your own message, how can you expect anybody to listen?
By contrast, Rishi Sunak is a much smoother public performer, which is why he was left wearing the crown at the end of the year. To his credit, he immediately managed to reassure the financial markets, and the pound has long since clawed back the catastrophic losses incurred during the Truss fiasco.
But is the Prime Minister too smooth, too metropolitan and — let’s be honest — too rich to win over the country at a time when living standards are under such intense pressure?
From the high drama of Boris Johnson’s fall to the low comedy of Liz Truss’s 49-day premiership, from the lurid allegations about Downing Street parties to a winter of crippling public sector strikes, it has been a political year like no other
And does he have the political subtlety and psychological backbone to emerge unscathed from his struggle with the public-sector union militants, whose walkouts have blighted so many people’s lives this winter? That, I fear, remains to be seen.
Amid all the gloom, though, we should recall that Britain has weathered similar storms in the past.
So does history offer any hope, as we enter 2023? Well, perhaps there are a few glimmers.
In wars, as in politics, the end can come very suddenly. So although some commentators warn that the war in Ukraine could turn into a long and bloody stalemate, it’s perfectly possible that the Russian war effort could collapse sometime in the spring — which would be great news for the world economy, as well as the heroic Ukrainian people.
Even if the war continues, the Bank of England expects inflation to fall in the middle of next year. So once Mr Sunak has ridden out the winter storm, he can probably look forward to calmer, perhaps even sunnier, weather ahead.
None of this, though, is cause for complacency. Amid all the chaos of the past 12 months, the Conservative Party seems to have lost any sense of drive or direction.
We are still waiting for some semblance of a solution to the crisis in the NHS, as well as the growing migrant crisis in the Channel.
So Mr Sunak has considerable work to do. Indeed, although the next election is not due until the end of 2024, the outcome will probably be decided in the next 12 months. And, at the moment, by far the most likely victor is Labour’s opportunistic Keir Starmer.
If the past year has taught us anything, though, it’s that only a fool dares to predict the twists and turns of the Westminster rollercoaster.
That now seems like a lifetime ago.
Today’s headlines belong to Ukraine, energy, strikes and inflation. And tomorrow’s? The only honest answer is that nobody knows.
Some readers may find that a bit worrying, and I can’t say I blame them. But it’s Christmas. So let’s be optimistic — and raise a glass to brighter days ahead.
