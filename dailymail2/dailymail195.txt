Mansour had previously considered a switch from rugby league to politics, but decided to reject the approach and focus on his return to the top level.

'I want to focus on my young family. I also still believe I have something to offer in the NRL. I'm not giving up hope of continuing my career. I'm training hard and holding out hope that an opportunity in the NRL will present itself.'
