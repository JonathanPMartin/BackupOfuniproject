RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: A proposal designed to discourage eco-maniacs from strolling in formation down the middle of the road is daft... Don't let Scotland Yard turn into the Ministry of Silly Walks

Brace yourselves. For once I agree with 
. We don't need new laws to deal with the eco-nutters who specialise in bringing traffic to a standstill.
: 'The police already have adequate powers to arrest people and move them on when they are obstructing the highway.'
Hallelujah. That could have been me speaking. Come to mention it, it was.
Time and again in this column I've insisted that there's already more than enough existing legislation to prevent 
 and whatever their latest offshoot calls itself this week causing mayhem on our streets.
Keir Starmer said on LBC Radio today that police 'already have adequate powers to arrest people and move them on when they are obstructing the highway'
RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: It's the panacea for all industrial...

Just as you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, so you don't need a former Director of Public Prosecutions to clarify the law on blocking the roads or behaving in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace. Try using the Public Order Act 1936, and updated in 1986, as a basis for negotiation.
So there is absolutely no need for the Government to bring in any new laws aimed at XR and Just Stop Oil protests. They should simply order the police to do their job properly.
Daftest proposal of the lot is the so-called 'slow walk' amendment, which is designed to discourage eco-maniacs from strolling in formation down the middle of the road.
In future, the Old Bill will be entitled to ask them to walk on the pavement instead. But only if it is judged they are causing 'serious disruption'. Only after a proper assessment has been carried out, will Plod be able to start arresting them.
And who is going to be the final arbiter? Will it be a sergeant? An inspector? A deputy assistant chief constable with a degree in what constitutes seriously illegal disruption?
Will we have to install a new generation of roadside cameras to record whether protesters are walking too slowly? And how slow is too slow — four miles an hour? Five? Given that London is now officially the most congested city in the world, with average speeds in the centre down to a shade over seven mph, if the protesters got a bit of a spurt on they could always argue they weren't causing serious disruption to anyone — especially as eco-friendly cyclists and e-scooter riders have their own dedicated lanes these days.
No doubt we will need additional legislation to clarify the exact interpretation of slow walking on the public highway, which will then have to be tested by the Supreme Court, before being referred upwards to the European Court of Human Rights.
Before long, a whole industry will spring up. A new Government department will have to be created to oversee it. Fifty years after Monty Python, we will finally end up with a real-life Ministry of Silly Walks.
And none of this nonsense would be necessary if only the police would stop playing Softly, Softly when it comes to these infuriating protests. Ignore their pathetic pleas that they need more 'clarification' to prevent a handful of headbangers bringing the King's Highways to a complete halt.
Of course, they don't. They are simply playing politics at the behest of their senior officers, who have all been brainwashed by the Left-wing freemasonry Common Purpose. From the start of these soppy, selfish, eco-protests, the Old Bill have bent over backwards to accommodate them.
Disco-dancing round a pink yacht in Oxford Circus, skateboarding with demonstrators blocking London Bridge, asking idiots glued to the M25 if they'd like a nice cup of tea . . .
The list of lunacy and outright dereliction of duty goes on.
So when Starmer insists that no new laws are necessary, he's right. But only because the Government and the police have until now lacked the courage and political will to stick up for the tax-paying, law-abiding majority whose lives have been made a misery.

Yes, in a nominally free society there should be a right to protest. But not to disrupt others going about their lawful business.
As I wrote when all this madness kicked off a couple of years ago, CND's Bruce Kent and the Aldermaston marchers had no trouble sticking to the pavement or confining their rallies to Trafalgar Square. The XR mob have deliberately disrupted travel and commerce, resorted to criminal damage and economic sabotage.
They have arguably cost lives, by stopping ambulances in their tracks. And yet they still attract widespread sympathy in Labour/Guardianista circles.
Where I part company with Starmer is his ludicrous insistence that by bringing in new legislation to deal with such protests, the Government is treating peaceful protesters like 'terrorists'.
Once a yuman rites lawyer, always a yuman rites lawyer.
Ultimately, this all boils down to politics. Starmer actually supports the aims of the back-to-the-Stone-Age eco-nutters, just not their specific tactics.
Otherwise he would have handed back the £360,000 donation he took from one of XR's principal backers, Dale Vince, tree-hugging chairman of Forest Green Rovers FC.
The police approach to protesters seems to depend on whether they are acting in a 'good' cause — such as saving the polar bears, or demanding more 'trans rights'.

If your demo is sufficiently 'woke', the Old Bill will give you a free pass, no matter how much misery you are causing.
But if Ukip supporters tried blocking the A2 in Kent in protest at illegal immigration, or Millwall fans occupied the pitch at, say, Forest Green Rovers, over a disputed VAR decision, the police would send in the heavy mob to start cracking heads straight away without bothering to consult the 'serious disruption' guidelines.
Just look at the contrast between the way they handle Just Stop Oil hooligans with how they baton-charged Countryside Alliance members and came down hard on frightened young women mourning murdered Sarah Everard during Covid.
So, no, Starmer's right. We don't need new laws. We just want the police to stop playing politics and do their job on behalf of the overwhelming majority of people who pay their wages.
We certainly don't need Scotland Yard becoming the Ministry of Silly Walks. Mind How You Go.
They were, we all agreed, the best of British. There was universal admiration for the eight young soldiers who carried the Queen's coffin on her final journey. These impeccable pallbearers epitomised the stiff upper lip, the dignity and majesty of the occasion.
, in London, where they stayed the night before the funeral, have been described as 'not fit for pests'.
The barracks are riddled with mould and damp. This horrifying report comes after a Mail on Sunday investigation into the appalling condition of military homes across the country revealed that sleeping bags have been handed out to soldiers and their families, some of whom have been without hot water for weeks.

Compare and contrast the squalid quarters being endured by the military with the comfy hotel accommodation being enjoyed by some foreign nationals who've crossed the Channel illegally — at a cost to taxpayers of almost £7 million a day.
It speaks volumes for the warped values and priorities of this Government and the Establishment in general.
We used to judge an army on how well it carried its wounded. Now we can only judge our country on how badly it treats its military, while some people who have come here illegally are living in luxury at our expense.
At least Her Maj is no longer around to see it. Makes you proud to be British.
, we feared the worst. All things must pass, according to George Harrison. And so the 1960s and 70s hits which were a staple of Wrighty's show have given way to more recent acts, most of whom I've never heard of. One listener said Scott's show is like being stranded in a nightclub. Wouldn't know. I gave up on it when Steve was ushered out.

Look, things change. But in pursuit of younger listeners on Radio 2, the Beeb has given us boomers no other channel to cater for our tastes in music. So allow me to point you in the direction of commercial rival Boom Radio, which is Hoovering up Radio 2's old audience. They've even asked me to do a turn for them next month, on Phil Riley's Still Busy Living, a sort of Desert Island Drunks show, where you talk about your life and career and pick some of your favourite records. So if you want to hear your Uncle Rich chewing over the price of fish and playing everyone from The Kinks to Squeeze, tune in to Boom on Feb 12, pop pickers.
