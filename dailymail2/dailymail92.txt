RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Dancing Queen Theresa? These days it's more like Money, Money, Money... I've heard her speak more times than I care to remember. And, frankly, I wouldn't give you tuppence for it

Be honest, how much would you pay for a ticket to hear 
 give a speech? A fiver? A tenner?
What if they threw in a rubber chicken breast and half a bottle of Algerian paint stripper?
Frankly, if Mother Theresa was giving a speech in my living room, I'd find an excuse to be upstairs washing what's left of my hair these days. Are people really queuing round the block to listen to May's pearls of wisdom?

Former Tory minister QUITS the party and brands it 'overcome...
Welcome on board the Westminster gravy train: MPs have raked...
It's certainly not my idea of a night out. As the late, great Peter Cook once told David Frost when he was invited to dinner with Air Miles Andy and Sarah Ferguson: I've consulted my diary and I appear to be watching television that evening.
I'd rather have a root canal than sit through 45 minutes of Mother Theresa's greatest hits, from 'Brexit means Brexit' to, er, actually I can't think of any others. So I'm astonished to learn some organisations are prepared to shovel shedloads of cash in her direction in exchange for a short speech.
For instance, May was paid £107,600 by the World Travel and Tourism Council for a talk at a conference in Riyadh.
For that kind of money, you'd expect her to perform the dance of the seven veils, as a basis for negotiation. She could always reprise her Dancing Queen routine from the Tory Conference. That would be good for a giggle.
They do say politics is showbiz for ugly people. Not that I'd be so ungallant as to describe Theresa as ugly.
But if she'd chosen a career in showbiz, rather than politics, she'd have been lucky to rise much above knife-thrower's assistant.
The pinnacle of her success may have amounted to being placed in a box twice nightly and sawn in half by a Tommy Cooper wannabe.
It would certainly have been a great deal more entertaining than her thoughts on matters of state.
But as the legendary showman P.T. Barnum once observed: There's a sucker born every minute. How else to explain a Californian company bunging May more than £400,000 for a series of six speeches?
Still, good luck to her. It all appears to be legal and above board. And if businessmen with more money than sense want to pay politicians for making speeches, that's their affair. Nice work if you can get it.
Boris is already coining it on the after-dinner circuit, and is poised quickly to pass the £2.5 million Mother Theresa has made from speaking engagements since she left Downing Street. Fair play to him. At least Boris is good value, although I'm told he churns out the same old schtick every time.
And, believe me, this after-dinner lark isn't easy. Back in the dim and distant, when I did a bit of TV, I got a call from my agent asking what I was doing that Friday night. Having a curry, I probably replied.
Did I fancy doing an after-dinner for the London Rubber Company, purveyors of prophylactics, instead?
Where do I have to be?
Big mistake. When I got there, most of the guests were already half-cut. It was the fag-end of a week-long sales conference and they just wanted to go home.
On the top table, I found myself sitting next to a female director of the company. In a light-hearted attempt to break the ice, I asked her who tested the recently introduced range of flavoured condoms, which had begun to appear on sale in pub toilets.
We all do, she said. Apparently they had weekly tasting sessions. Malibu flavour was particularly popular, she explained.
'Do you do cheese and onion?' I asked.
No call for it, she replied with a straight face. From that moment on, I knew I was doomed to die a death.
I've never been tempted again. Leave it to the professionals, of whom there are many superb speakers. You might have thought that speech-making was all part of a politician's job description. But if someone's stupid enough to pay them a small fortune to do it, I guess it's just one of the perks. No harm done.
Far more sinister are the vast sums ladled in the direction of politicians for nothing in particular. Those presumably seeking influence are prepared to shower MPs with everything from free holidays to sizeable cash donations.
A joint investigation by Sky News and the Westminster website Tortoise Media has revealed that three prominent Labour MPs have between them received £345,217 from an outfit called MPM Connect. Sky's heckler-in-chief Sam Coates even took time off from shouting 'When are you going to resign, minister?' to travel beyond the Bubble to the company's registered address in Hertfordshire.
The woman who answered the door had never heard of MPM.
Turns out it's an investment vehicle run by a Labour-supporting businessman. But that still doesn't explain what the money is for and what he expects to gain from it.
Nor why he'd choose out of the goodness of his heart to give 184,317 of his English pounds to the Shadow Home Secretary Pixie Balls-Cooper. Perhaps it's so she can build an extension to accommodate all those Syrian refugees she promised to take in.
The same benefactor has also given £100,000 to former South Yorkshire mayor Dan Jarvis and £60,900 to Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Why? And what does he want in return for his generosity?
It may well be that his donations are pure altruism. But that can't always be said for the largesse laid on for politicians elsewhere, especially overseas.
Tortoise Media investigators also discovered the extent of foreign trips enjoyed by Members of Parliament and their spouses.
If Theresa May had chosen a career in showbiz, rather than politics, she'd have been lucky to rise much above knife-thrower's assistant
Highest-flyer is Tory MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale David Morris, who has taken 29 foreign jollies, 13 of them with his partner and parliamentary assistant Emma Smith.
Countries they've visited include Gibraltar, Turkey and Armenia. The cost of all this is estimated at over £66,000. In the process, Morris has acquired Prince Andrew's 'Air Miles' nickname.
Of course, many MPs' overseas jaunts are perfectly legitimate. Others, not so much.
A report which disappeared under the radar over Christmas revealed that some MPs treat these 'fact-finding' missions about as seriously as a Jolly Boys Outing to Margate.
Another investigation by the website Politico claimed MPs and peers have used all-party trips abroad for sex tourism and heavy drinking.
One ex-minister is said to have asked for the address of the nearest brothel when he landed in South-East Asia. A Labour MP is reported to have a particular fondness for Russian girls, another for Chinese women.
On one trip, MPs arrived to find hot and cold running prostitutes already waiting in their rooms.
Say what you like about Mother Theresa, but you can't imagine her asking the way to the nearest knocking shop next time she's invited to address a room full of tech tycoons in San Diego.
Let's hope that after bunging her 100 grand they think they're getting their money's worth.
Maybe she and Boris should team up and start treading the boards together.
I'd pay good money to watch him saw her in half.
But over the years, I've heard her speak more times than I care to remember. And, frankly, I wouldn't give you tuppence for it.
