The kilt-wearing hunky Army officer and equerry for King Charles has sent hearts aflutter once more after being spotted at tonight's royal carol 
 headed to Westminster Abbey for today's festive performance, some have swooned over an officer spotted in the background of photographs.
Major Jonathan Thompson of the 5th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland could be seen standing closely behind Kate as she smiled for the cameras in front of a snowy 
Major Jonathan Thompson, 39, was spotted at Westminster Abbey tonight behind the Princess
The officer, who was once the Queen's most senior bodyguard, has found himself increasingly more in the spotlight following King Charles III's ascension to the throne. 
The man known to his friends as 'Johnny' was front-and-centre of watching over Charles's first public walkabout as Monarch. 
He also escorted Prime Minister Liz Truss to meet the King at Buckingham Palace prior to her resignation. 
The Major is often seen wearing a thick tartan kilt with a large fur sporran and a number of medals are pinned to his uniform.
The Major was Her Majesty's most senior bodyguard during her reign as Monarch
The hunk met Prime Minister Liz Truss outside Buckingham Palace ahead of her first audience with the new King
But to the disappointment of his admirers, the 39-year-old Major has been married to Caroline, 44, for around 12 years.
Together they have a four-year-old son and two labradors known as Odin and Piper in Surrey.
Despite most people thinking Major Thompson is Scottish, he was actually born in  Morpeth, Northumberland.
In 2006 he joined the army as a Platoon commander, according to his LinkedIn.
His profile also reveals how he attended Aberystwyth University where he graduated in 2004 with a degree in Economics and politics with international studies. 
For the past two years it is said that he has been working as an equerry with the King. 
Major Johnny Thompson was spotted behind Prince Harry and Megan when they attended the National Service of Thanksgiving to celebrate the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June earlier this year
Today's Christmas concert at Westminster Abbey is being held in recognition of the selfless efforts of UK communities.
The concert is taking place on the same day that the final three episodes of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's explosive 
Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace declined to comment on anything in the series.
