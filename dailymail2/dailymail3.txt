Two sides... speaking different languages: STEPHEN DAISLEY sees a house divided over Scotland's gender bill

When the final vote was read out, the public gallery erupted. Trans activists clapped and ministers and government backbenchers applauded them in return.
 benches, they sat in silence. The response was similarly muted among the Labour ranks. A lot of people very much want the issue of gender reform to go away. Given the 
’s threat to block the Bill, this seems highly optimistic.
Just as the Presiding Officer was restoring order, protesters from the other side began shouting ‘shame on you!’ For a parliament born out of political consensus, Holyrood is very good at dividing Scotland.
The First Minister protested that she was well aware of the dangers to women of predatory men but insisted her Bill did not put women at risk. Ross pressed further and she gave more or less the same answer again, and then they did it one more time
Scotland's new gender laws: What is the Gender Recognition...
UK ministers set to resort to never-before-used legal powers...
The day had not begun with such excitements. The final FMQs of 2022 was a low-watt affair. MSPs had just endured two consecutive 12-hour mega-sessions on the gender Bill. Wednesday’s business didn’t finish until 1.30am yesterday.
Everyone was running on empty. Even unfailingly gentle presiding officer Alison Johnstone was low on patience. I lost count of the number of times she admonished the First Minister to make her answers shorter.
Douglas Ross dropped his voice to that quiet and deliberate register he adopts when he wants to sound ‘above politics’. He asked Nicola Sturgeon why she had voted against an amendment that would have blocked people from changing their gender while on trial for sex offences.

Each was making their case clearly but neither could understand the other. It was this whole process in a nutshell: a debate about definitions between two sides speaking different languages.
They say God loves a trier and it’s hard to disagree with Him when it comes to Rachael Hamilton. The Borders Tory was one of the Bill’s staunchest opponents and, in the dying seconds of FMQs, as the final vote was set to begin, she thought she had them.
You see, Holyrood has rules to ensure the proper spending of taxpayers’ money. (Please, no sniggering in the back.) If the estimated costs of a Bill ‘increase significantly’, the legislation must pause until parliament has agreed to the extra spending.

Hamilton argued the various amendments had surely increased the Bill’s costs. It was a valiant last stand. Alas, the Presiding Officer ruled the spending was within permitted limits.
Hamilton was sporting a handsome scarf in the colours of the Suffragette movement. Her Tory colleague Tess White wore a similarly-hued lanyard. Not to be outdone, the SNP’s Joe FitzPatrick and Karen Adam boasted a rainbow tie and rainbow lanyard, respectively. Only in the absurd theatre of Holyrood could clothing accessories become a political battlefield.
There wasn’t much left to do. The Bill passed, they moved on, finishing up business for Christmas.
There couldn’t be a better time for MSPs to get away. Not only are some ill-disposed to talking to certain colleagues after all this, a fair few voters would prefer it if their legislators didn’t do any more legislating for a while.
The air in Scots politics has become polluted with rancour. It’ll take more than a Christmas break for it to clear.
