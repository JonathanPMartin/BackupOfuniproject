The mother-of-one spoke about reflected on the gendered politics of raising a boy versus a girl 
'My son, babies, have this genderless quality to them, and so I love affording that to him right now. I've just been treating him as this wonderful little human who's being introduced to the world,' she said.
'...The best I can do is teach him compassion, and about these power dynamics that men don't have to inspect in the way that women do, and make him aware of them and make him care about them.

'How's that going to happen? I'm not entirely sure,' she confessed, adding that she thinks the culture she talks about in her book — which includes being objectified and sexual assault — is 'very bad for men.'
'I also think that this culture that I'm writing about in the book, is very bad for men. There are books about how bad it is for men. I see it in my life, the ways that it limits men, and how depressing their existence and their lives can be when they have to adopt this toxic masculinity. So I also feel incredibly protective of him in the same way I would with a daughter, from this culture.'
She maintained overall: 'I think there just aren't good and bad men. Yes, it's not all men, and at the same time, it's all men.'
'My son, babies, have this genderless quality to them, and so I love affording that to him right now. I've just been treating him as this wonderful little human who's being introduced to the world,' she said
Additionally Emily spoke about the complicated nature of her modeling career, saying that immediately she saw the correlation between money and freedom and money and beauty.
'Autonomy and freedom and control come with money, and I knew that at a very young age,' she said.
'...Everybody also always reminded me that modeling has a very specific window and that if you don't do it when you're young and beautiful, it goes away. So I made the decision to jump on that, directly into an industry that when I got sick with the flu and lost some weight, I watched the number on the scale go down and the number of my paychecks go up.'
