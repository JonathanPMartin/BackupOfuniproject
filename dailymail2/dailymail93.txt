Cristiano Ronaldo's 2013 Ballon d'Or award was auctioned off for charity back in 2017, fetching a price of around £532,000 for the Make-A-Wish foundation from Israel's richest man. 
With the real trophy reportedly on display at his Madeira museum, Ronaldo specifically asked for a replica to be made to sell at a charity auction in London, according to contemporary reports from

Ronaldo's 2013 trophy rose £531,780 for Make-A-Wish, a charitable organization that helps fulfil the wishes of critically ill children after Oder's winning bid, although it was then-agent Jorge Mendes that handed over the award not Ronaldo. 
Ronaldo scored 55 goals in as many games for Real Madrid in 2012-13
Of his five awards, 2013 was a year that saw the then-Real Madrid icon narrowly pip Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery to the post, after the French forward won the treble with Bayern Munich in the 2012-13 season.
And Ribery was open in sharing his feelings after losing out on an award he feels he deserved more than his rivals. 
'I'm not sad, but it hurts the heart,' he told German newspaper AZ Munchen. 'Do not get me wrong, I am proud to have been there. 
'I feel I deserved this title. There are so many politics.'
Ronaldo scored 55 goals at a goal-a-game for Los Blancos, but failed to win a trophy with Bayern taking the Champions League and Barcelona winning LaLiga. 
Ofer is worth a reported £8.1billion according to 
, and having made his fortune through a combination of mining, shipping and energy, moved into the sports industry. 
The 37-year-old won his second of five Ballon d'Or awards in 2013 having won his first in 2008
Ofer invested in Real's arch rivals Atletico Madrid later in 2017, before buying a controlling stake in Portuguese side Famalicao. 
But the 37-year-old's second of his five trophies was not the only item up for grabs at the London auction. 
A meet-and-greet with Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho was sold for around £26,500, among other prizes on offer.
