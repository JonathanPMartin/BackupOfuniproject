 News' The Papers review last night as it hosted its final edition after it was axed in a channel cost-cutting drive and political controversy. 
Presenter David Eades was in the chair for the 18-minute segment, which had been a nightly look at the following day's physical newspaper editions.
He was joined over video call by Kevin Schofield, political editor of Huffpost UK, and Eleanor Langford, politics reporter at Politics Home, to give their view on stories.
The show was cancelled after the BBC announced it was merging the BBC News channel and the BBC World News channel to create one single 24-hour offering.
The segment had recently been in hot water after presenter Martine Croxall's Boris reaction

A total of 70 jobs are at risk and it has been reported 14 current presenting roles will be slashed to just five.
The final edition brought to an end of ten years of analysis of newspaper front pages and articles, that once saw one presenter call Tyson Fury 'a d***head'.
Former presenter Martin Croxall mourned its departure, adding: 'It was great fun to present BBC Papers when it started in 2013 along with Clive Myrie.
'We have Sam Taylor to thank for launching it when we moved from TV Centre.'
A total of 70 BBC jobs are at risk and it has been reported 14 current presenting roles will be slashed to just five
BBC presenters eulogised the programme as it aired its final ever segment late last night
Martin Croxall said the show - which discussed papers - had been likened to a Parisian salon
She added: 'Anne Ashworth always said it was like a Parisian salon where big ideas were discussed.
'Mihir Bose said he forgot we were on TV because it was so relaxed. Like sitting chatting at home.'
Croxall was memorably chastised by bosses after celebrating Boris Johnson had pulled out of the most recent Tory leadership contest.
She was taken off air for a short period after she reacted by saying: 'Well this is all very exciting, isn't it?' adding: 'Am I allowed to be this gleeful? Well I am.' 
Clive Myrie added: 'End of an era tonight as the last edition of The Papers goes out on the BBC News Channel.
'At one stage this programme had more viewers than Newsnight and was regularly the most watched show on the Channel by a country mile.
'It was sort of about the papers, but I always saw it as a late night chat with the smartest people around, chewing the fat on the big issues.
'I had a whiskey, the guests had their tipple and we were chatting late night! I'm sure Martine Croxall imagined she had a very nice Pinot.'
Fan Jonathan Neil-Smith said on Twitter: 'Sorry to see it go. Was usually a refreshing conversation about current affairs stimulated by the front pages.
'Perhaps some creative thought needs to be given as to how to retain some of that stimulating input.
'Must have been quite economical given the use of on line facilities.'
The BBC said in a statement ahead of the closure of The Papers: 'As part of these changes there will be some scheduling changes and some items may move, or be provided in different ways across the BBC channels.'
