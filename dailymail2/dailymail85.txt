Don’t say we were never warned! This article about the failing NHS written 32 years ago by the Daily Mail’s legendary columnist PAUL JOHNSON, who died last week, STILL rings true today

For too long, the NHS has been 'in crisis'. For too long, cowardly politicians of all parties, like ostriches with their heads in the sand, have failed to tackle the issue or admit that the NHS is not sustainable in its present form. This abrogation of responsibility is a betrayal of everyone who pays taxes in the expectation of being treated when ill.
It is shameful that in 2023, patients wait more than 11 hours to see a doctor and emergency waiting times are at their worst for a decade. How risible to claim the NHS is 'the envy of the world'.
Labour politicians peddle the myth that heartless Tories are hell-bent on destroying the health service. But what about the striking unions? Or Labour itself, which refuses to countenance reform?
These issues aren't new. In May 1991, Daily Mail columnist Paul Johnson, who died last week, wrote this trenchant analysis of the NHS. Read his words which we reprint below and weep that three decades on, so little has been done to make the NHS fit for modern times and the seemingly endless demands put upon it.
For more than two decades Paul Johnson, who has died aged 94, was a regular columnist on the Daily Mail, where he displayed the extraordinary breadth of his knowledge, as well as trenchant opinion, on all manner of subjects

The NHS is the sacred cow of British politics. Everyone has to say how marvellous it is. No one dare attack it, except by stealth.
Many of those who work in it are dedicated and industrious. Others are under-employed.
In many ways, the NHS is an old-fashioned nationalised industry: inefficient, overmanned, over-unionised and a staggering financial burden. It employs well over a million people, only two-thirds of whom are directly involved, as doctors and nurses, in tending the sick.
The only other institution in Britain which has a longer payroll is local government, itself a byword for profligate use of manpower.
The supposedly niggardly Tory Government raised spending on the NHS by a third in real terms.
Most of the new cash was instantly swallowed by union demands for higher pay and shorter hours.
Now fundamental reforms are beginning to bite. The abler, more intelligent doctors are taking financial charge of their own practices.
The result was foreseeable: they are slashing their payrolls. The move has been highlighted by the decision of Guy’s Hospital in London to put its finances on a sound basis.
Equally foreseeable was Labour’s reaction: screams of outrage and accusations that the NHS is being assassinated.
Sensible people will shut their ears and wait for results.

We ought to have learned by now that mere numbers do not guarantee efficiency, especially in a state-owned concern.
Fewer employees and greater efficiency often go hand-in-hand.
There’s no need to protest that the NHS is not an ordinary industry. Everyone knows that. But it is significant that some of the cleverest people in the business, including the best of the consultant doctors, are enthusiastically in favour of the reforms because they believe the service will benefit.
One consultant surgeon has said: ‘For years the health service has been a vehicle of employment rather than a provider of health care.’ He said it ran efficiently only during the Winter of Discontent ‘when non-essential staff were on strike. A reduction in the number of administrators, social workers and counsellors could only be beneficial. This would leave doctors and nurses free to get on with their job of looking after patients.’
This kind of criticism of NHS over-manning – shared by many more doctors and senior nursing staff than dare to speak out – is confirmed by the figures.
In the past 30 years or so, the number of people employed by NHS hospitals has risen. Yet the number of patients treated has gone up by only a half.
The impression that something is seriously wrong is confirmed by a physical comparison of NHS and private hospitals. The NHS variety, however excellent the health care actually provided, gives the impression that they are run by the unions.
British author, historian and journalist Paul Johnson, who shifted his allegiances from the left to support Margaret Thatcher and Conservative causes, died on January 13
Meanwhile, large numbers of patients sit around waiting – often for hours, sometimes much longer.
One of the first things the unions did was to get rid of the matron, that symbol of old-style industry, cleanliness and discipline. With her elimination, a certain scruffiness began to take over, even in the high prestige teaching hospitals.
But even more lacking than matronly order is the financial discipline of making ends meet.
Private hospitals have no bottomless taxpayers’ purse to draw on and must get value for money to survive. On their premises there are no queues, either, no waiting. Appointments are kept on time. The working assumption is that the time of everyone – doctors, nurses, staff and patients – is valuable.
Britain is a country in recession and after years of surplus, the public finances are running into serious deficit. Private firms of every kind are being forced to make painful economies to survive.
It is simply not right that the NHS should escape the efficiency drive.
Of course the Labour Party will rant. Some NHS hospitals seem to operate as a giant system of outdoor relief for party supporters. Many of those who will lose their jobs are party militants. The unions, which will see their power eroded, help to form the hard core of the Labour establishment.
All this is bad news for Labour and excellent news for the rest of us. And especially for the patients.
There is an iron law of nationalisation from which the NHS is by no means exempt: public-sector industries are run in the interests of those who work for them, instead of those who use them.

The Government is on course for replacing the iron law with a new one: the patient comes first. The transformation will take time.
Labour will set up the most almighty emotional caterwauling to deafen the elector into believing the NHS is being starved to death.
In fact, subjecting public hospitals to a rigorous slimming cure will eventually release huge sums of money for new equipment, new research, better facilities and higher standards of health care.
Moreover, it will allow harassed hospital managements, many being driven to actual insolvency by inflated wage bills, to think positively about the new medical science of health promotion, and begin to invest in it.
Therein lies the future for Britain’s NHS. The Tories are prepared to take serious political risks in accelerating it. And once again, Labour is revealed as the reactionary party.
