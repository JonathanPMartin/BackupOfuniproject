'Done in the style of a Cbeebies presenter!' Britons compare Rishi Sunak's voice to Will from The Inbetweeners and poke fun at him for sounding like he's 'reading a bedtime story' while delivering his first big speech as Prime Minister
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made his first domestic policy speech as PM 
Unfortunately for the PM who is almost 80 days in office, he was mocked online
Many Twitter users compared his deliver to that of a CBeebies story reader 
Other said his voice was the same as Will from The Inbetweeners

 18:02, 4 January 2023 
 has been compared to a 'CBeebies presenter' who assumed the electorate were all aged four. 
The PM, in his first major domestic speech since replacing 
 at Number 10, attempted to slice into Labour leader Sir 
's lead in the opinion polls. 
Speaking in East London, Mr Sunak stood in front of a blue background which provided ample opportunity for technically proficient jokers who could digitally manipulate the  broadcast. 
The PM addressed the nation standing in front of a blue background which was a blessing to internet comedians
One Twitter user digitally manipulated the PM's broadcast to transpose him onto the CBeebies set

Environmental campaigner Brendan May tweeted: 'Mate, you are the leader of a 
 economy not a CBeebies presenter; please stop assuming all voters are four years old.'
Mr Sunak was made fun of by Britons online, who compared the PM to the awkward fictional character Will from the hit show The Inbetweeners.
LBC presenter Shelagh Fogarty addressed the PM's speech during her show. She described the address as 'dull and boring' claiming it could have been subbed down to five minutes. 
She added: 'He does have the tendency to sound like a head boy in tone, and at worst a Cbeebies bedtime story reader.'
Jess Rowlands claims she laughed when 'Rishi just mentioned crack addicts in his best CBeebies presenter voice'. 
Kate Henaghan-Sykes continued the analogy: 'Rishi Sunak is giving this speech like we are all children and this is a Cbeebies bedtime story. Please finish by saying, if you don't honour your promises you will calll a general election. We will all live happily ever after that, I'm sure.'
 Mr Sunak's delivery style was criticised extensively online
Others compared him, uncharitably, to the head boy of an 'overpriced public school' addressing an assembly, though many social media users drew comparisons between the Prime Minister and Will - the main character from comedy series The Inbetweeners.
An older Twitter user said Mr Sunak sounded like a Jackanory presenter. Jackanory was on the BBC between 1965 and the mid 1990s. 
Other people said he had the manner of a 'supply teacher' and someone trying to read 'Roald Dahl to an A-Level statistics class'. 
Dozens of social media users compared the PM's delivery technique to that of a CBeebies bedtime story person or the character Will from 'The Inbetweeners' comedy series
