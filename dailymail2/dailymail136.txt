Germany boss Hansi Flick has claimed that his players and fans should 'concentrate on football' and leave the politics to those 'trained' following the controversial World Cup in Qatar.
The 57-year-old was echoing the words of French President 
The Germany boss could not hide his disappointment that many fans at home had decided to boycott watching the national side compete on the global stage.

Germany had a dismal World Cup campaign as they were knocked out at the group stages for the second tournament running
After the protest and as the match kicked off, the German Football Association (DFB) released a statement emphatically supporting its team, saying: 'To ban the armband is like banning our right to speak.' 
Germany went on to pick up a point against Spain in a 1-1 draw, and beat Costa Rica 4-2 in their final fixture.

Despite their dismal showing at the World Cup, 
Flick - who played for and managed European giants Bayern Munich - will lead the national team at Euro 2024, which will be played in Germany.
