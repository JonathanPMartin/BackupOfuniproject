The Royal Family are 'completely exhausted' with the 'stream of misinformation' from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, sources claimed last night.
The comments come in the wake of 
publicity blitz for his new autobiography, Spare, set to be released next week, during which he has claimed his family 'have shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile'.

 Tom Bradby and CBS's 
A royal insider told the Mirror: 'It all feels very repetitive. Harry's constant sniping is rather draining and he knows full well it is highly unlikely they will engage in a tit-for-tat battle of words.'

Harry and William's relationship 'hangs by a thread'...
Harry and William 'will NEVER reconcile after his book':...
'I would like to get my father and brother back': Harry says...
Another source added that the duke's claim that his family refused to reconcile with him was 'unadulterated nonsense.' 
Buckingham Palace has refused to comment on the trailers, which were filmed
In the trailer, Harry says 'it never needed to be this way' and refers to 'the leaking and the planting' before adding: 'I want a family, not an institution'.
He also says, in an apparent reference to the royals, 'they feel as though it is better to keep us somehow as the villains'. The comments are unlikely to help the frayed relationship between the Sussexes and the rest of the Firm which sources say is already 'hanging by a thread'.
Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said: 'The interview Harry and Meghan gave on Oprah [in 2021] did very considerable damage to the Royal Family, especially the allegations of racism and issues dealing with Meghan's mental health.
'Over the last month, counting the new trailers about his forthcoming interviews about his memoir, Harry and Meghan have appeared in a two-part six episode docuseries for Netflix and no less than seven trailers, two for the first docuseries, three for the second and now two more. 
'The first overshadowed the second day of the Prince and Princess of Wales's trip to Boston which was outrageous. This resembles a publicity circus which looks rather desperate.
'Harry might like to get his brother and his father but must surely know giving this catalogue of woes even more exposure is not the way to do so.
In trailers released ahead of the interviews yesterday, Prince Harry was heard saying: 'I want a family, not an institution'
Who is Tom Bradby? Friend of the Sussexes who asked Meghan 'are you ok?' in 2019 South Africa interview  
Tom Bradby, a former royal correspondent who now presents ITV News At Ten, is a friend of the Sussexes and previously interviewed them for a documentary about their 2019 Africa tour. 
He famously asked Meghan about her mental health, with the duchess thanking him and replying: 'Not many people have asked if I'm ok'.   
In their recent Netflix series, Meghan said the interview marked a turning point. 
The 2019 interview in which Mr Bradby asked Meghan about her mental health  
She said: 'There is only so much you can take on your own, so you end up saying, ''Something has to change''. It was a huge turning point. 
'It was when we started having harder conversations about what needs to happen for us to be able to continue to make this work.' 
Mr Bradby first got to know Harry when he worked with him on a documentary about Lesotho when the prince was on his gap year after leaving Eton.   
The journalist went on to attend his 2018 wedding to Meghan. 
'Further accusations of stories being planted against them by the Palace in both interviews show how bitter he and Meghan still are but, though their fans may support it, there will come a time when even the media tire of exposure at this level.'
He added that the public will expect claims that Mr Bradby, who has previously landed exclusive interviews with the couple, had questioned Harry closely to be backed up in the final interview.
Mr Fitzwilliams said: 'Oprah never probed and the interview was notorious for the way "their truth" and the truth were conflated. The Netflix docuseries was hagiographic. 
'Will Anderson Cooper on CBS and Tom Bradby for ITV subject Harry to serious, detailed questioning? That would be well worth seeing.
'Harry says in the trailer for the CBS interview, referring to the Palace's inability to protect them from false reports, that "there comes a point when silence is betrayal". 
'There is also a point, if they wish any relationship however distant with the Royal Family, when silence is common sense. When will the Sussexes learn this?'
Harry, 38, also spoke to US TV personality Mr Cooper for his popular interview programme, 60 Minutes. 
A trailer shows Mr Cooper asking why Harry had not communicated his grievances against the Royal Family in private rather than going public. Harry replies: 'Every single time I've tried to do it privately there have been briefings and leakings and planting of stories against me and my wife. 
'The family motto is never complain and never explain – it's just a motto.'   
He adds: 'They [Buckingham Palace] will feed or have a conversation with a correspondent, and that correspondent will literally be spoon-fed information and write the story, and at the bottom of it, they will say they have reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment.
'But the whole story is Buckingham Palace commenting.
'So when we're being told for the last six years, ''we can't put a statement out to protect you'', but you do it for other members of the family, there becomes a point when silence is betrayal.' 
The clips appear to confirm reports that Harry will use his memoir to reveal 
The duke claimed in his Netflix documentary, Harry &amp; Meghan, that William 'screamed and shouted' at him during crunch talks at Sandringham over his decision to step away as a working royal.
Mr Bradby, a former royal correspondent for ITV, is a friend of the Sussexes and previously interviewed them for a documentary about their 2019 Africa tour. He first got to know Harry when he worked with him on a documentary about Lesotho when the prince was on his gap year after leaving Eton. 
The Duke of Sussex, pictured here speaking to Anderson Cooper, held the interviews in California
ITV said that Mr Bradby's show Harry: The Interview will go into 'unprecedented depth and detail' about his life in and outside the Royal Family. 
Meanwhile, Mr Cooper is said to have won Harry's trust through his stance on issues such as mental health.  
The 55-year-old, who is also a star of the CNN network, has campaigned to promote better mental health and hosts a podcast called All There Is. 
A television source said: 'Mr Cooper has won Harry's trust. This would be a coup for Mr Cooper and fits well with Harry's campaign to promote mental health. 
'It is a prime-time Sunday show which hosts foreign leaders and presidents. It's the one that all the politicians and decision-makers watch.' 
Harry told Mr Cooper that, when he tried to air grievances privately, stories would be planted in the Press against him and his wife 
In 2020 Mr Cooper interviewed Afua Hirsch, a British author and former Guardian journalist who features in the Sussexes' Netflix programme. 
In the discussion with Mr Cooper after Harry and Meghan announced they were leaving their royal duties, Ms Hirsch described the Firm as 'Ground Zero for Britain's troubled history of colonialism and race'.
She added that she was 'always concerned about Meghan Markle's wellbeing' when joining the family. Appearing sympathetic to the couple's plight, Mr Cooper told Ms Hirsch: 'The notion of being hounded by the Press is going to have such strange, weird echoes for Prince Harry given what happened to his mom.'
Harry's autobiography, which will be released on January 10, is expected to include further attacks on William and his wife Kate. However, Spare will reportedly see 
, which has been strained since Harry and 
 announced they were relinquishing their royal duties in 2020, will not recover. 
: 'Generally, I think the book [will be] worse for them than the Royal Family is expecting.
'Everything is laid bare. Charles comes out of it better than it had expected, but it's tough on William, in particular, and even Kate gets a bit of a broadside. 
'There are these minute details, and a description of the fight between the brothers. I personally can't see how Harry and William will be able to reconcile after this.'

The Duke of Sussex is expected to make claims in the book that could put even more strain on the frayed relationship between himself and his brother 
Harry's tell-all tale was written with JR Moehringer, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist who previously penned the biography of US tennis star Andre Agassi. 
The Duke of Sussex will personally narrate the audiobook version of the memoir.  
Reports have emerged that Meghan is also planning to publish her own bombshell memoir.
According to one source, the 
 'is contemplating getting entirely candid about her time in the royal limelight… and leaving no stone unturned'.
In 2021 the couple reportedly signed a four-book deal with publisher Penguin Random House. 
Prince Harry is said to have received a $20million (£17million) advance for Spare. 
Meghan has already released her children's book The Bench with the same publisher, and it is rumoured that the couple are working on a 'wellness' book. 
Now it is believed the mystery fourth book will be the duchess's autobiography. 
A bestselling memoir could further fuel rumours that Meghan has political ambitions given her outspoken views on women's rights and other issues.

The Duke of Sussex's autobiography Spare will be released in bookshops in the UK from January 10 
A Hollywood agent told The Mail on Sunday: 'I would find it surprising if Meghan didn't publish her own story, to be honest. Spare is clearly Prince Harry's chance to tell his story, but hers is equally compelling. I mean, how many actresses end up marrying a prince?'
The source added: 'If she's harbouring political ambitions it would make even more sense,' pointing out that presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all wrote books setting out their beliefs before launching bids for the White House.
The duchess, a Democrat, has become close to America's 'political royalty', the Kennedy family. She was honoured last month alongside her husband with an award from the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights non-profit organisation. 
The organisation's leader Kerry Kennedy – niece of former US president John F. Kennedy – said the Sussexes received the award for their stand against 'structural racism' within the Royal Family. 
There are reports that Harry's wife, Meghan, will also write her own autobiography in the coming months 
It could further fuel rumours that Meghan has political ambitions given her outspoken views on women's rights and other issues 
Meghan is also good friends with feminist campaigner Gloria Steinem who is still closely involved in liberal politics. A friend of Ms Steinem's said: 'Meghan has strong views very much in alignment with Gloria's in terms of social justice and women's rights. Gloria is encouraging her to make her voice heard.'
But some have warned that the Sussexes may be in danger of overexposure. 
One senior Hollywood executive said: 'We've had the Oprah Winfrey interview, then the Netflix series and now we've got Harry's book. You have to ask if the world really needs to hear Meghan's story right now? If I was advising her I would caution against releasing a book too quickly because there is a very real danger that people will start experiencing "Sussex fatigue".
'There comes a point where people might feel they've heard the same stories too many times. They have to change the narrative at some stage and focus on the future rather than past transgressions.'
Meanwhile, Harry's book has been billed as being written with 'raw, unflinching honesty'. 
Who is Anderson Cooper? Son of Vanderbilt heiress with a tragic family history

As a CNN anchor and host of CBS's 60 Minutes, Anderson Cooper, 55, is one of America's most prominent broadcast journalists.
As well as co-anchoring the 2016 presidential debates he's carried out sit-down interviews with some of the world's most prominent politicians, from Joe Biden to Emmanuel Macron. 
Despite an estimated net worth of $200million, Mr Cooper only inherited around $1.5million from his late mother's estate after she spent most of her fortune while she was alive.
He's previously vowed to take a similar approach with his son, Wyatt, due to a 
that it is wrong to pass on large amounts of money.  
Mr Cooper regularly campaigns on mental health issues and has spoken openly about losing his brother Carter to suicide.
