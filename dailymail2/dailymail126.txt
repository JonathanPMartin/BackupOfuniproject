Lingard had played for Manchester United from the age of seven until 29 but was not allowed to leave the club in a way he would have liked.
The attacking midfielder missed out on an opportunity to say goodbye to the Old Trafford faithful and as a result was looking forward to this fixture. 
Lingard said: 'This is a chance to say my goodbyes because I never really got that. It will be an enjoyable occasion but we want to win the game. You can't get caught up too much in it emotionally.'
It appears that both Lingard and the United fans took his substitution as an opportunity to finally say goodbye as he took his time walking towards the changing rooms.  
Lingard was unhappy with his exit from Manchester United and finally got to say goodbye
During his last season at Old Trafford, Lingard felt he was mismanaged by those in charge of the club.
Lingard admitted: 'I'd rather that someone had told me, 'This is why you're not playing', out of respect for me being there so long, but I never got that.
'It was false promises. I was training hard and I was sharp, I was ready.'
Lingard has started to find his form for his current club Nottingham Forest and will be hoping to continue to kick on in the second-half of the season.
