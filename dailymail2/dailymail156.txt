 has joked that he's expecting another baby with his wife Tana, three years after welcoming his fifth child Oscar.
The TV chef, 56, quipped, 'One more on the way!' when Jamie Theakston asked how many children he had during a Tuesday appearance on the Heart breakfast show.
He went on to tease of the broody 48-year-old, 'Tana’s jeans aren’t fitting her,' to which 
 or is it a baby?'

Gordon replied, 'Do you know what, I don’t know yet. I’ll double check when I get back. I’m going to Boots on the way back from here and I’ll double check.'
Jamie then said, 'Have you inadvertently just revealed something you weren’t meant to say?'

Gordon admitted: 'Tana would like another baby and I’m like, “No no no," it’s already hard enough when I take Oscar to school, they say, "Hey what’s your grandad’s name?” on sports day.
'Jamie when I’m standing there with a stick and an egg and spoon thinking, “Holy…”

Amanda said: 'I hope she’s up the duff again, that would be brilliant,' before Jamie concluded, 'You know how much trouble you’re going to be when you get home!'
Oscar is the youngest of Gordon and wife Tana's brood - with the pair also sharing Megan, 24, twins Jack and Holly, 23, and Tilly, 21.
However, he seemingly doesn't mind obliging the strange requests, he finds it 'weird' when asked to swear in front of his three-year-old son Oscar.
Hilarious: The TV chef, 56, quipped, 'One more on the way!' when Jamie Theakston asked how many children he had during a Tuesday appearance on the Heart breakfast show 
Funny: He went on to tease, 'Tana’s jeans aren’t fitting her,' to which Amanda Holden asked, 'Is it Christmas or is it a baby?'
, he explained: 'They say, "Can you tell me to f**k off?" I don’t know why. I get it at traffic lights, "Oi Gordon, tell us to f**k off you k***head" - from a van driver to a lawyer to a NHS nurse.
'If I am stood there with Oscar (his three-year-old son), it is a bit weird.'
Meanwhile, Gordon opened up on his new TV show Next Level Chef, where he told that his swearing if not only aimed at contestants, but his fellow judges too.
Next Level Chef will see an array of hopefuls including home cooks, influencers, and professional chefs battle it out for a £100,000 prize and 12-month mentorship.
He's joined by Californian chef Nyesha Arrington and his former protege Paul Ainsley, with Gordon telling how their first meeting for the show was 'packed with a lot of curse words.'
He added: 'I’m not trying to make amends, it is an industry language, no different to politics over the last couple of months. There were a lot of f**ks coming out of there. It is an industry language, I don’t focus on the camera, I focus on the moment to make sure it is right.'
The chef went on to add that while he sometimes communicates with expletives, he has one definitive way of telling contestants he hates their food - by spitting it out.
He added that if something appears inedible to him, there would be 'no way on Earth' that he'd swallow it.
Not cool: Gordon said: 'It’s already hard enough when I take Oscar to school, they say, "Hey what’s your grandad’s name?” on sports day'
