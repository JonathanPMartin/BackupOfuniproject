Maria Thattil has slammed the way 
The model and influencer, 29, weighed in on the subject and its role in social media politics on Channel Nine panel show 
Cancel culture, or call-out culture, refers to the act of ostracising a person - usually forcing them out of social or professional circles - because of their problematic statements or behaviour.
Maria Thattil (pictured) has slammed the way cancel culture has developed over recent years 
Cancellation is becoming increasingly commonplace among celebrities, with the main drivers of the movement being social justice activists on Twitter.
'I think if somebody is actively and consistently abusing power, oppressing and hurting others, and they have absolutely no remorse for the harm they're causing, then I think they should lose a bit of cultural cachet,' Thattil said.

But she argued that over time the idea of cancel culture has become less about holding people accountable and more about public shaming.
'For the most part, cancel culture is this thing that just attacks people for opposing views,' she explained.
The model and influencer, 29, weighed in on the subject and its role in social media politics on Channel Nine panel show Talking Honey on Wednesday 
She argued that over time the idea of cancel culture has become less about holding people accountable and more about public shaming 
'It's like you make a little mistake, or you slip up, and it's almost always something someone can learn and evolve from. But in the digital climate, people are so quick to judge and throw stones.'
Thattil's fellow panellist Shelly Horton agreed, saying cancel culture needs 'to get cancelled'.
'Guess what, people? It's okay to be a little bit offended. Life isn't peachy all the time,' she said.
'For the most part, cancel culture is this thing that just attacks people for opposing views,' she explained 
It comes after Thattil insisted she won't become a mother despite being 'hot and fertile'.
She was inundated with negative comments from critics who implied she would be left lonely without a family after she spoke of her child-free lifestyle on Instagram.
'It's not just okay to not aspire to parenthood – it is your human right,' she wrote in response.
'When they tell me that a child-free life means I'm not fulfilling my "duty as a woman", I tell them that my value isn't conditional on whether I birth someone else, and my only duty is to myself.'

She continued: 'And when people threaten me with fear of loneliness in my latter years, I tell them that I fear their decision to have kids just so they have someone by their side when they're old and ailing.
'I say we stop asking [women] when they're going to hit these milestones, and start asking what they want to do with their big, powerful lives.'   
When a fan asked about her decision to remain childless, Maria said she finds fulfillment in her career and has much more she wants to accomplish.
