A former Tory MP who quit in shame after admitting watching pornography in the House of Commons wants to make an unlikely return to politics, he confirmed today.
Neil Parish, 66, resigned his Tiverton and Honiton seat in May after confirming he had viewed smut on his phone while sitting on the famous green benches.
 subsequently lost his previously safe seat to the Liberal 
, one of a series of embarrassing election reverses last year.
But father of two Mr Parish, whose friends said he had been trying to research tractors when he stumbled across X-rated material, told Times Radio today he had 'unfinished business' in politics.
And he threatened to run as an independent if his former party failed to select him.
'The seat that comes very close to my farm is the (new) Tiverton and West Somerset seat. I would very much consider standing there at the next general election,' he said.

'Then I have the option of also standing as an independent … there's a certain draw for me actually to have a shot as an independent.'
 Mr Parish, who lives on a family farm in Somerset, called time on his 12-year spell as an MP in May after he admitted to twice watching pornography in the Commons chamber.
Allies claimed had been searching online for 'Dominator' combine harvesters when he first came across an adult website, which was spotted by other Tory MPs in the chamber with him.
Following Mr Parish's resignation, the Tories lost a subsequent by-election in Tiverton and Honiton to the Liberal Democrats.
It saw the Lib Dems overturn the biggest majority in by-election history, 24,239, to clinch the Devon constituency with a majority of more than 6,000.
At the time, Mr Parish ruled out running again as a Conservative candidate, adding: 'I don't think they would have me.'
The former chair of the Commons' Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee has previously revealed how police 'kindly' confiscated his shotguns to prevent him from shooting himself after his political scandal.
Mr Foord told MailOnline: 'The Conservatives were sent a message last June by people in this part of Devon who didn't want to be taken for granted any longer.
'Regardless of who they pick as their candidate for the next election, the choice will be simple: the West Country continuing to be ignored by out-of-touch Conservatives, or positive change with the Liberal Democrats.'
