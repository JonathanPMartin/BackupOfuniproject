'We can never accept that in this region or any other region – and it is just worth mentioning we've got a government in our country that are demonising rail workers, ambulance workers and terrifyingly nurses.
'We can't have people being paid an absolute pittance to work, we can't have people in accommodation that is unsavoury and disgusting.
'It shouldn't happen here [in Qatar] ... with the wealth that exists. But it shouldn't happen with the nurses in our country either where our nurses are having to fight for an extra pound or two pounds.'

 Redknapp agreed that it was 'hypocritical' of Neville to make the comments after covering the World Cup in Qatar and insisted that it wasn't fair to make his comparisons.
Redknapp said: 'How can you compare what's going on out there with what's going on with train drivers and nurses.
'We want to see nurses get more money, of course we do, they're fantastic.

Former Tory party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said ITV should have cut off Neville, who is a member of the Labour Party. He added: 'People have been killed on building sites and things all over Qatar and paid a pittance, and he compares that to the UK? It's unbelievable.
'To compare a country that demonises gay rights, executes and brings in migrant workers by the truckload and pays them a pittance to a democratic country that has the concept of human rights, rule of law and all that goes with it – he's abused his position.'
Lee Anderson, Conservative MP for Ashfield, said: 'It's a classic case of another champagne socialist who's got more money than sense. ITV should sack him.'
On Twitter he added: 'Another party political broadcast by a millionaire. Looks like ITV is on my banned list now. Talk about football Gary and keep your nose out of politics. You don't know what you're talking about.'
